<br /><span class="h2line2">GREAT AUNT KATHERINE COMMANDS</span></h2>
<p>Two boys and a girl climbed down out of the
bus from Middletown when it made its final stop
in front of the summer hotel at the head of Broad
Street. The boys, between them, were carrying the
girl&rsquo;s books and a goodly number of their own, for
they were returning from the last session of the
school year. To-morrow summer holidays would
begin. They nodded a friendly good-bye to the driver
and started off up the steep little elm-roofed street
that sloped directly up to Ashland College, an institution
for girls, perched on the highest plateau of this
hill town. The boys&rsquo; father was a professor in that
college and the girl&rsquo;s mother an instructor. But in
spite of their privilege of living in the lap of learning
these young people had to take a daily nine-mile bus
ride down into the bigger village of Middletown if
they themselves were to get college preparation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The boys were twins. They were tall and spare,
even for boys of sixteen, and seemed all angles.
They had thick thatches of auburn hair, whimsical
faces, and generous, clear-cut mouths. The girl
was sturdy, slightly square in build, with brown,
straight bobbed hair. The bobbed hair was parted
at the side and brushed away in a wing from her
forehead, and this gave her a boyish, ready look.
Her eyes were hazel and very clear and confident in
their level glance, but when she smiled, as she did
often, they crinkled up into mere slits of eyes, because
they were slightly narrow to begin with, and then
she seemed oddly Puckish. Her mouth was wide
and her lips rather full, but for all of that, because of
its uptilted corners, it was really a very nice mouth.
She trudged along now between her two friends, the
corners of her mouth more uptilted than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s vacation! At last!&rdquo; she was
saying. &ldquo;Mother and I are going to have just the
nicest summer. We&rsquo;re going to take long walks we
never took, make a new vegetable garden, and eat
almost every one of our meals out-of-doors when it
isn&rsquo;t raining. We may even if it does rain! When
will your tennis court be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get right at it to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
Sam Hart, the twin on her left, answered. &ldquo;It
ought to be finished by the middle of July or sooner
if they&rsquo;ll let us borrow the roller from the Hotel.
Then if your mother is as patient as usual with us,
we may be champions ourselves before the summer&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s crazy to play,&rdquo; Kate assured them. &ldquo;But
she says we must remember she hasn&rsquo;t touched a
racket in years and that you have to keep in practice
to be any good at tennis. It was seventeen years ago
she won that cup at the Oakdale Country Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have begun playing when she was in
creepers,&rdquo; Sam exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought it was a regular
cup, a real and regular tournament affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, of course. And she was nineteen, foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s thirty-six now then.&rdquo; Lee did the arithmetic.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny that, being so old as all that,
she has always seemed just one of us. Where did
you ever get such a mother, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I took my time about choosing,&rdquo; Kate
answered, apparently seriously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t snatch
at the first thing offered. I said &lsquo;better not have
any mother at all than one who isn&rsquo;t magnificent.&rsquo;
So I kept my head and refused to consider anything
commonplace. You know the result, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys did not bother to respond even with a
laugh. They were used to Kate&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>But now in their climb up the steep elm-shaded
street they had reached the college campus on the
&ldquo;Heights&rdquo; and Professor Hart&rsquo;s house set into its
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my books,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;Thanks for
carrying &rsquo;em. If I do a lot of weeding in the court,
perhaps it&rsquo;ll pay you a little for having been such
good pack-horses for me all this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sam shook his head at the outstretched hands.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming on with you,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;How
about you, Lee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Lee responded. &ldquo;Wait a second till
I pitch these things on to the piazza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate protested. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s almost
supper time. The bus was late. We&rsquo;ll be busy,
Mother and I. Come after supper, instead, and help
us decide where the new garden is to be. Perhaps
mother will play Mah Jong with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but agree when Kate
took a dictatorial tone. The boys meekly gave a
pile of books into her arms and turned in at their
own walk.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s mouth kept its uptilted corners as she
went on alone, humming to herself and thinking
pleasant thoughts. She skirted the forsaken campus
a little way and then took a short-cut across its
lawns. She knew that the last student had left to-day,
and there would be no &ldquo;grass police&rdquo; to shoo
her back to the paths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great having all the girls gone,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;Now I shall have a little of Mother to myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Kate was justified in her pleasure in the girls&rsquo; departure,
for those older girls did take an unconscionable
amount of Katherine Marshall&rsquo;s time and
thought. Of course, Katherine had to teach them,
Kate realized&mdash;that was how she earned their living.
But she did not understand why, outside of classroom
hours, they need be always underfoot. Kate
was proud of her mother&rsquo;s popularity, but often
exasperated by it, too; for those older girls never by
any chance paid any attention to Kate herself.
They were polite, of course, but most perfunctorily;
it was her mother they came to see and on her least
word and motion they hung almost with bated breath.
The truth was that these indifferent, superior girls,
always present and never of any use to her, turned
the college year for Katherine into a loneliness that
even her mother scarcely realized.</p>
<p>There were the Hart boys, of course, always. But
boys cannot take the place of a girl comrade. Kate&rsquo;s
mother was all the girl comrade she had. That was
why she had not let the boys come with her now.
For once, she would be sure to find her mother alone,
and the hour would take on, for Kate, something of
the nature of a reunion.</p>
<p>The house she now approached, across the street
from the campus to which it turned its low and vine-hung
back, had formerly been a barn. The college
had made it over for Kate&rsquo;s mother into a charming
cottage which despite its turned back was still part
of the college property. Kate found her mother
sitting on the little garden bench at the side of the
big double doors that had once been the carriage entrance
and now stood open all spring and summer
facing the hazy valley. Her cheek was resting on
her hand and the expression in her eyes was a very
far-away one, a farther away than the valley one.
But she became very present when she heard Kate&rsquo;s
step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kate, I thought you would never come!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Read this letter.&rdquo; She picked it
up from the bench beside her and handed it to Kate.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from your Great Aunt Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why Kate exclaimed &ldquo;Again&rdquo; would be hard to
say, for within her memory Great Aunt Katherine
had only written her mother once before, and that
was all of two years ago! That letter had been to
tell of the sudden death of a semi-relative, a woman of
whom, until that time, Kate had never heard.
Would this have news of another death? It must be
something of importance that had wrung a second
letter from Great Aunt Katherine.</p>
<p>Flinging her books on the grass, and following
them herself to sit at her mother&rsquo;s feet, Kate opened
the smooth, thick, creamy sheet and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Katherine:</span></p>
<p>I am asking you to send your daughter Katherine to spend the
month of July with me here in my Oakdale house. Unexpected
business in Boston is keeping me from my usual trip abroad this
summer. I do not know whether I told you when acquainting
you with Gloria&rsquo;s tragic death that her daughter was left without
home or protection of any sort and that I proposed to take
her in. But such was the case. Naturally, ever since, the
child has been peculiarly lonely here in Oakdale. And now that
she no longer has her day school in Boston to occupy her, the
situation is a really trying one. It has occurred to me that
Elsie and your Katherine are very nearly of an age, both fifteen,
and that they might find themselves companionable. So I
am asking you to forget old grievances, as I shall, and send
your daughter to me for a month&rsquo;s visit. I shall plan parties
and theatres and good times for them, and promise you that it
will be every bit as gay as it was when you were a young girl
here, and not too independent then to let your aunt give herself
pleasure by planning for yours. I have looked up trains and
find that by leaving Middletown at one o&rsquo;clock, Katherine,
with only one change, will arrive in the South Station in Boston
at six-fifteen. I shall expect her on that train Saturday of
this week, and Bertha, Elsie&rsquo;s maid, will meet her and bring her
out here in time for dinner. If for any reason that is not a
convenient train for Katherine to take, will you please wire me
what time she <i>will</i> arrive?
<span class="center">Sincerely,</span>
<span class="jr">Aunt Katherine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Kate looked up at her mother, dazed. &ldquo;Just like
that!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Does Great Aunt Katherine
expect us to obey her just like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine was grave. &ldquo;Yes, she has always done
things like this. That&rsquo;s been the trouble. And
when things don&rsquo;t go exactly as she has commanded
that they should, she is at first unbelieving and then
furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm. And who is Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie is Nick&rsquo;s little girl, and a sort of foster-niece
to Aunt Katherine now, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Nick&rsquo;s wife who was killed in the automobile
accident in France, wasn&rsquo;t it? But why haven&rsquo;t
you told me about her, about this Elsie? I&rsquo;ve always
wanted a cousin so, Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she isn&rsquo;t exactly a cousin, you know. But
even so, if Nick and I hadn&rsquo;t quarrelled, if we had
stayed as we were, in the course of things you would
have known each other and perhaps have been very
dear friends. It would have been natural.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother&mdash;quarrels! When you are so lovely,
how have people quarrelled with you so? It&rsquo;s a&mdash;<i>paradox</i>.
Now don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve used the wrong word!&mdash;But
here&rsquo;s more, more to the letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had turned the letter over and discovered a
postscript on the back. Katherine, who had missed it,
bent down, and they read it cheek to cheek.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. I will add, for this will perhaps make your acceptance
the quicker to come to, that Nicholas&rsquo;s name is never mentioned
here, either by me or the servants, or even Elsie herself. So
that end of things need cause you no anxiety. Elsie is a charming,
well-mannered child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That paragraph had not been intended for Kate&rsquo;s
eyes. Katherine understood that at once, but it
was all that she did understand about it. She
frowned, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how she says &lsquo;Make your acceptance
quicker to come to&rsquo;,&rdquo; Kate pointed out sharply.
&ldquo;She takes it for granted you&rsquo;ll come to it, apparently.
If there is any question, it&rsquo;s only one of time.
But why isn&rsquo;t Nick&rsquo;s name mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine shrugged. &ldquo;I am afraid she must have
quarrelled with him, too, just as she did with your
father and me. But if that&rsquo;s so it must be terrible
for both of them, since he owes her so much and she
counted on him so to make up for Father and me and
later you, Kate, and everything! How could he
quarrel with her? Why, he should have put up with
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Katherine&rsquo;s cheek was again on her hand. Her
face was all puzzle. &ldquo;And why should Elsie be
lonely in Oakdale?&rdquo; she went on aloud, but almost
to herself now. &ldquo;Oakdale is quite a gay little place,
and I know very well there are plenty of young people
there. Some of them are children of friends of mine,
friends I haven&rsquo;t seen since I was married. Why,
there are even the Denton children, just next door
to Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;s all very mysterious,
Elsie&rsquo;s being lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But mystery where Great Aunt Katherine was
concerned was no new thing to Kate. Whenever
she thought about Aunt Katherine at all it was always
to wonder. Why should her mother be estranged so
entirely from her only living relative, this aunt for
whom she had been named, and who had been a second
mother to her after her own mother had died, when
she was a very little girl? Kate could never understand
that situation. Katherine was so peculiarly
gentle and forgiving and lovable! How could any
one stay angry with her?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Last year, when Kate was fourteen, Katherine had
tried to explain things to her a little. She had said
then that Great Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s money was the
cause of the feud. Only it was not the usual
trouble that money makes in families. It was not
that Aunt Katherine was selfish or proud. It was&mdash;oh,
absurdity&mdash;that she was over-generous! She
expected to force her generosity on her family
whether they wanted it or not. It had begun with
Kate&rsquo;s Grandfather Frazier. He and Great Aunt
Katherine were half-brother and sister. When
Katherine was about Kate&rsquo;s age now, Grandfather
Frazier had failed in business and the very same
month Great Aunt Katherine had inherited a
fortune from an uncle on her mother&rsquo;s side. Until
that turn of fortune&rsquo;s wheel Aunt Katherine had
been a school teacher living with her half-brother
and giving her spare time to mothering her namesake
niece. When she woke up one morning to find
herself a wealthy&mdash;a very wealthy&mdash;woman, she immediately
decreed that her brother should share the
good fortune with her just as she had for so long
shared his home with him and his child. But Grandfather
Frazier&rsquo;s pride forbade him to acquiesce in
that. The uncle was not his uncle, and it was not
only his pride but his sense of propriety that influenced
him in his firm decision not to accept one cent
from Aunt Katherine. All that he would allow her
to do to help his financial situation was to buy the
house from him in which they were living so that with
the money he might pay his debts. Thereafter he
insisted that she was his landlady and he made a
fetish until the month of his death of being on time
with the absurdly small rent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine had built herself a large and mansionlike
house on part of the land that went with
her brother&rsquo;s little house. And since he distinctly
limited her in the things she might do for his
daughter, she adopted, suddenly and to every one&rsquo;s
amazement, a poor young boy, with no background
whatever, who had been brought up in a &ldquo;Home,&rdquo;
and who at the time of her discovering him was working
in a factory. She prepared him herself for college,
sent him to Harvard, and thrust him, almost
head first, into the &ldquo;younger set&rdquo; in Oakdale. He
had married Gloria, a beautiful young Bostonian
but with no especial &ldquo;connections.&rdquo; That was all
that Kate knew of him, except for this late knowledge
that he had a daughter.</p>
<p>Kate could understand her grandfather&rsquo;s pride,
dimly. But her mother&rsquo;s case was not so clear to
her, not quite. Her mother had married a rising
young diplomat, a man of supposedly some wealth
and assuredly fine ancestry. But on his death,
not long after Kate&rsquo;s birth, it was discovered that
there was not a cent to which the young widowed
mother could lay claim. Katherine had never explained
to Kate how this had happened. She
hardly knew herself perhaps, because the processes of
Wall Street were a maze to her. Almost gleefully,
Aunt Katherine had seized upon this opportunity to
offer her niece a home with her and a substantial
allowance so that she might feel independent in that
home. Katherine had refused point blank. And
Aunt Katherine, now very sensitive on the subject
of rejected generosities, had made a clean break with
her namesake, washed her hands, and dropped her
out of her life, much as one might drop a thistle that
had pricked too unreasonably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Katherine, determined to earn her own and her
little daughter&rsquo;s way, had obtained an instructorship
here at Ashland College, worked hard and happily
ever since, and gloried in her independence.</p>
<p>The whole reason for this choice of poverty and
hard work Katherine had not told Kate. But she
had hinted that there was a very deep reason and one
that justified her. Sometime, perhaps, she would disclose
it. Meanwhile, Kate gave all this little thought,
and was only brooding over it now because of the
letter in her hand.</p>
<p>After a minute she said firmly, &ldquo;If Great Aunt
Katherine thinks I&rsquo;m going to leave you here alone
on this deserted hill-top for a whole month of our
precious vacation, she has a surprise in store. Shall
we write or wire our regrets, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better write,&rdquo; Katherine answered, getting
up suddenly and beginning in an unusually energetic
way to pull up weeds from the lily-of-the-valley bed
under the window. &ldquo;I shall write that Saturday is
too soon, for there must be some preparation on our
part for such a visit. By next Tuesday, though, I
should think you could be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate turned her head to follow her mother with
amazed eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m to go, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want you to go. I want you very much
to go. Aunt Katherine apparently needs you. I
think, though, she must be drawing on her imagination
a bit as to the loneliness of Oakdale for Elsie,
especially since she herself says there will be parties
and good times for you. You can&rsquo;t have parties
without young people! Even so, her saying she
needs you makes our acceptance not only dignified
but imperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to leave you here alone! How could I ever
do that? What are you thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine laughed at her daughter then. She was
extraordinarily pretty when she laughed, startlingly
pretty. But when she sobered, as she was bound to
do too quickly, she was quite different, still lovely
but not startling. Her face, sober, was intensely
earnest. She had a rather square and strong chin
but with wide, melting gray eyes to offset it. Her
dark curly hair, which when undone came just to her
shoulders, could be held in place at her neck with only
a shell pin or two, it was so amenable in its curly crispness.
Her cheeks and little slim hands were tanned,
but with healthy colour showing through, making
her, Kate often said, exactly the colour of a golden
peach. She was slim and very graceful and not tall.</p>
<p>But in spite of all Katherine&rsquo;s loveliness and feminine
charm, the impression one gained from her
was one of over-earnestness, a fire of intense purpose
steadily, even fiercely burning under the outwardly
gay and light manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Now she was laughing. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you
leave me alone?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t be so
alone, either. The Harts are staying. The boys
will be my protectors and my playfellows both. I&rsquo;ve
been a fortunate woman all these years to have two
such boys as well as my girl! And three mornings a
week, you know, I shall be busy helping Mr. Hart
with his cataloguing.... Now we shall have
to collect all our wits and think about suitable clothes
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart began to beat. When she had read
the letter she had not let herself even contemplate
what going would mean, not for an instant; for she
had not dreamed her mother would so fall in with
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s plan. But since she had fallen in
with it, since she wanted her to go&mdash;well, it was very
exciting! For the first time she might have for a
comrade a girl, a girl of her own age, a chum! For
if Elsie, that stranger unheard of until a few minutes
ago, was lonely, What was she, Kate Marshall? Oh,
she would surely be gladder of Elsie than Elsie could
possibly be of her!</p>
<p>She went to the border of the lily-of-the-valley bed
and began weeding beside her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what we&rsquo;ll do about clothes,&rdquo; she
said a little tremulously, not yet really believing
in this new vista that seemed opening before her, like
the valley there, at her very feet. &ldquo;If I do go, I suppose
Aunt Katherine will expect me to dress for
breakfast and dinner and supper and in between
times in that splendid house of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not quite so bad as that; but she certainly
will want you to have&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;two ordinary
gingham dresses, a little dinner frock, a party frock,
a white dress for church, a sport coat and hat, a
garden hat, a street hat, a street suit, a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>But Kate interrupted this list with a quick laugh.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll want in vain, then. Let&rsquo;s get down to business
and just discuss the must-be&rsquo;s, if I <i>am</i> to be a pig
and go and leave you here alone for July with a vacation
on your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine straightened up, brushing the soil from
her fingers. Her quick ear had caught a joyous lilt
in the voice and laugh that to an ordinary ear would
have sounded merely dry. Her own heart leapt in
sympathy with Kate&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately there&rsquo;s my pink organdie. That
must do for dinners,&rdquo; the mother began, counting on
her earth-stained fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Mother darling, <i>my</i> pink organdie. It&rsquo;s
been mine for over a year. Why will you go on calling
things yours for years and years and years after
they have descended? There&rsquo;s <i>my</i> pink organdie
then. It&rsquo;ll have to do for church and for parties and
for summer best just as it would if I were here. Two
gingham dresses almost new. The blue flannel&mdash;but
that will be too warm and scratchy for July, I&rsquo;m
afraid. Oh, Mother, that&rsquo;s just all. I simply can&rsquo;t go
to Great Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll never know Elsie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can. Haven&rsquo;t we always found a
way to do the things we really wanted? Wait a
minute. There&rsquo;s my new white linen. I shall fix
that for you. But your gingham dresses will never
do, not for Oakdale. Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to give your white linen to me. It&rsquo;s
the prettiest thing you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! It will make a charming street suit. It
will need a black silk tie and a patent-leather belt.
I can <i>see</i> you in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, but you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; But when Kate saw
her mother&rsquo;s dazed, puzzled little frown that invariably
met her rare impertinences, she relented.
&ldquo;Oh, Mother,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m to have your very
best things added to mine, of course I shall be perfectly
fixed. It will be a regular trousseau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything but these old smocks,
staying here,&rdquo; Katherine insisted. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
exactly what I shall do, give you everything of mine
that can possibly be of any use. For once in your
life you are going to have just an ordinary young girl
good time. And if you and Elsie do hit it off, perhaps
Aunt Katherine will consent to her coming
back with you for the rest of the vacation. Come,
let&rsquo;s spread all our possibilities out on the beds and
see what there is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after we&rsquo;ve pared the potatoes for supper,&rdquo;
Kate agreed, trying desperately to hold on to her last
shreds of casualness and poise. &ldquo;We had better
have supper to-night, I suppose, whether I go to
Great Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s or not. It must be six
o&rsquo;clock now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine threw an arm across Kate&rsquo;s shoulder as
they went through the big door. &ldquo;How fortunate it
is,&rdquo; she said, not for the first time, &ldquo;that I have such a
steady, common-sensible little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate would not abide her own hypocrisy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, don&rsquo;t make me feel cheap!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You know perfectly well that I&rsquo;m just
bursting with excitement, only I&rsquo;m ashamed to show
it, for it&rsquo;s you who are going to be left at home doing
just the same old things and seeing just the same old
people and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m happy doing just that,&rdquo; Katherine hurried
to assure her. &ldquo;Why, you yourself, Kate, have
been looking forward to your vacation here and planning
it with such pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es. But that was before this came. Now
I don&rsquo;t see how I could bear the thought of just staying
here! Now that I&rsquo;m going to have pretty clothes
and go to parties and meet some boys and girls, and
have a girl chum of my own&mdash;why, what I was so
looking forward to doesn&rsquo;t seem anything at all. I&rsquo;ve
suddenly waked up, and there&rsquo;s a big door open right
in front of me, bigger than our funny old front door!
I&rsquo;m going through it, right into such fun! Only I&rsquo;m
leaving you behind. That isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Katherine was quick to understand. Kate&rsquo;s whole
mood was as real to her as though it were her own.
She said, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see, dear, I <i>had</i> all that fun
a thousand times over when I was a girl. Aunt
Katherine gave me parties galore and took me to the
theatre as often as Father would let her and there
was anything worth seeing. And now that you are to
have some of that life for a month, I am delighted.
I only wish Aunt Katherine had asked you sooner.
I have truly always hoped she would. Only, I suppose,
she thought I was like Father and wouldn&rsquo;t
accept things for you any more than for myself. And
oh, Katie dear, do try to be patient with Aunt Katherine,
no matter what she does or says! Perhaps you
will make up a little to her for what I have taken
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood now in the kitchen, facing each other.
Suddenly Kate laughed, her nicest laugh that screwed
up her eyes into slits and turned her into a Puck.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put off supper then,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Stodgy
old suppers we can have any night. Let&rsquo;s get out
all the clothes we&rsquo;ve got and just plan. I&rsquo;m not going
to let you touch any of your good ones for me. I&rsquo;m
truly not. But there may be some old things we&rsquo;ve
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re really common-sensible, my dear,&rdquo;
Katherine affirmed. &ldquo;Before it was only pretend
common-sensibleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And arm-in-arm, without one look at the kitchen
clock which now was pointing to all of quarter past
six, they went through the funny, merry little barn
house toward the bedrooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BOY IN THE FLOWERY, DRAGONY PICTURE FRAME</span></h2>
<p>During the next few days of hurried preparation
for the visit the Hart boys found themselves
almost entirely left out of the life in the little barn
house, the house that ordinarily served as a second
home for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time for boys to-day,&rdquo; Kate would call out
crisply when they appeared at windows or door.
&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s business is afoot. We&rsquo;re too busy even
to look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katherine, who was usually so much more
easily beguiled and quick to see their side in any
argument, for once echoed Kate and upheld her in
her determination to stick to the tasks they had set
themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In spite of all Kate&rsquo;s protests, Katherine&rsquo;s new
white linen was ripped to pieces and remade for the
traveller into a jaunty street suit. With a black tie
and narrow black patent-leather belt, when it was
finished it looked as though it might have come from
some fashionable shop in New York. Kate could not
help being delighted. The pink organdie, which had
done Kate duty for best all last summer, and Katherine
for best for several summers before that, was now
freshened with new lace and decorated with narrow
black velvet ribbon. It was not only becoming, but
quite up-to-date, and when it was finished and Kate
surveyed herself in it in the glass, standing on a chair
to see it all, they both decided that Kate would be
able to put clothes definitely out of her mind when
she was wearing it, for it was quite appropriate for
all the occasions it was destined to grace.</p>
<p>And finally, Katherine&rsquo;s pretty bedroom was
robbed of its month-old chintz curtains which, under
her magic, in the space of two days only, became two
simple but unique and pretty morning dresses for
Kate. Now all that remained to be thought of in
the way of clothes was the travelling suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My navy blue silk will do perfectly,&rdquo; Kate said.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m a little careful, it won&rsquo;t hurt it any, and next
winter it will be as good as ever for your teas and
things, Mother, unless I&rsquo;ve quite grown out of it.
Anyway, travelling won&rsquo;t spoil it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that was agreed upon it naturally followed
that Katherine&rsquo;s new spring hat must go with it; for
it was a little navy blue silk hat, light and small and
quite fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ll ever do for a hat I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Kate
worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about me,&rdquo; Katherine told her nonchalantly.
&ldquo;Here on this hill-top anything does so
long as it gives a shade. And if ever I go down to
Middletown I can wear your black tam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>In the silk dress and hat and with her last spring&rsquo;s
blue cape with its orange silk lining Kate felt prepared
to meet the eyes of even Elsie&rsquo;s maid with
equanimity. But imagine a girl of fifteen having a
lady&rsquo;s maid!</p>
<p>Katherine thought that was just a glorified title
for nurse, probably. But Kate protested that. A
nurse for a girl of fifteen would be even more absurd
than a maid. Well, Katherine was sure Aunt Katherine
herself wouldn&rsquo;t have a maid. She was a New
Englander with all a true New Englander&rsquo;s scorn of
self-indulgence. But she probably did need someone
to keep Elsie mended and possibly to be a sort of
chaperon for her, too; for Aunt Katherine, since her
inheritance, had interested herself in social and charitable
work and was a very busy and even an important
woman.</p>
<p>The two had endless conversations about Aunt
Katherine and the adventures awaiting Kate. And
Katherine talked more than she had ever talked before
about her own girlhood in Oakdale and the little
orchard house where she had always lived and where
she had been so happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t rented you must go into it,&rdquo; she told
Kate. And then she described the rooms for her
and all the important events that had happened in
them. Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s big newer house she hardly
spoke of at all, for Kate herself was so soon to see it
and know all its corners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>All the planning and sewing and the long intimate
conversations about Katherine&rsquo;s girlhood and bits of
family history that Kate had never heard before, kept
her right up to the eve of departure occupied and
excited. But as bedtime approached that night she
began to be shaken by unexpected qualms. She had
never before been away from her mother for even one
night and they had always <i>shared</i> adventure. That
now she was actually to go off by herself into an adventure
of her own seemed unnatural and almost
impossible.</p>
<p>They were sitting on the bench out beside the big
front doors, breathing in all the cool night air they
could after the last hot and rather hurried day.
Their faces were only palely visible to each other in
the starlight. They had been silent for many minutes
when Kate said suddenly, and a little huskily,
&ldquo;Mother, may I take the picture of the boy in the
silver, flowery, dragony picture frame along to Oakdale
with me to-morrow? He&rsquo;s a sort of talisman of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine was used to Kate&rsquo;s abruptnesses and
seldom showed surprise at anything anyway. But
now she did show surprise, and the voice that answered
Kate quivered with more than surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silvery, flowery, dragony picture frame?
And the boy? What do you know of him, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s always been in the little top drawer of
your desk. He&rsquo;s <i>always</i> been there. I&rsquo;ve never told
you how much he meant to me. I&rsquo;ve made it a
secret. But I&rsquo;ve known him just about as long as I
can remember. I was an awfully little girl and had
to climb on to a chair at first to see him. But I
didn&rsquo;t climb to look often. I saved it for&mdash;magic.
When something dreadful happened, when I was
punished or lessons were just too hateful, or you
were late coming home, then I&rsquo;d climb up and look
at that boy in the frame for comfort. I think it
would be very comfortable to have it with me along
with your picture, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine did not answer this for some time. She
stayed as still as a graven image in the starlight.
Finally, without moving at all, and in a voice as cool
as starlight, she asked, &ldquo;But why did you make it a
secret? I don&rsquo;t understand a bit. I didn&rsquo;t know
you even knew there was a little upper drawer. It&rsquo;s
almost hidden, and there is a secret about the catch.
You have to work it just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. And I can&rsquo;t remember how or
exactly when I discovered how to work it. At first,
I do remember, it was just the frame I loved. It is
a little wonder of a frame! The silver was so shining,
and then the flowers and the fruit <i>and</i> the dragons
are all so enchanting. I traced the dragons with my
finger over and over and played they were alive. I
thought it was too mysterious and lovely, all of it!
It fascinated me in a way I could never tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Katherine remained silent and Kate went on:
&ldquo;It was only when I was older I began to look at the
picture and feel about that so strangely. I discovered
what a wonderful face that boy has. I pretended
he was the Sandman, the one who gave me my
dreams at night. I always had such wonderful
dreams, Mother! Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine did not answer, and Kate felt somehow
impelled to go on. She was surprising herself in this
account of past childish imaginings. She had never
thought about it in words like this before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be just the person to have made those
dreams for me. His face said he knew them all and
thousands and thousands more! Then, when I got
older I forgot about his being the Sandman, and anyway,
my dreams stopped being wonderful and were
just silly. Then I called him the &lsquo;Understander.&rsquo;
When I especially wanted an understander I&rsquo;d open
the secret drawer&mdash;I could do it without climbing on
a chair by then&mdash;and there he was, looking up at me
out of the dragons and the fruit and the flowers with
<i>understanding</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all just a notion, of course. Oh, am I
talking nonsense, Mother? And was it nonsense to
keep it so secret and all, always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine answered emphatically, &ldquo;No. Not
nonsense a bit. Only surprisingly&mdash;intuitive. For,
Kate, he is just the sort of person who <i>could</i> have
made up those wonderful dreams you used to have.
And he was&mdash;and is still, I suppose&mdash;just a perfect
understander. That is his quality. And it is
startling to me, all you have said, for he has been a
sort of a talisman to me, too, all these years. I&rsquo;ve
looked at him, at the picture, when <i>I</i> needed understanding.
And that is surprising in itself, for once,
when he was just the age he is in that picture, the
very week the picture was taken, I did him a wrong,
a great wrong. We quarrelled. Since then I have
never seen or heard from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Kate turned upon her mother with real exasperation
at this disclosure. &ldquo;Oh, Mother! How could
you! Another quarrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine said nothing, and Kate instantly softened.
She felt that she had wounded her mother;
and that was a dreadful thing to have happened on
this their last night! It was in an apologizing tone
and humbly that she asked then, &ldquo;And may I take
him with me to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think you&rsquo;d better not. Let him stay just
where he is, in the secret drawer. I may need his
magic more than you while you are away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So her mother wasn&rsquo;t really hurt at all, or cross.
She had spoken lightly, even airily. Kate sighed
her relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you who the boy is,
notice?&rdquo; she spoke as lightly as her mother. &ldquo;It
might spoil the magic if I knew a human name for
him. And I don&rsquo;t believe you ever did him a wrong,
either. For one thing, I don&rsquo;t believe any one could
do him a wrong. And you never did any one a wrong,
anyway. I know it. You&rsquo;re too dear and kind.&mdash; Look
at those fireflies out there. Watch me catch
one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Kate suddenly jumped up and ran away into the
summer evening. Katherine stayed still on the
bench, watching her quick motions, her leaps and
runs and turns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very like a dance,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Only there should be music.&rdquo; And she
began humming softly.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Kate slept that night with the twinges of premature
homesickness dulled by fatigue. And when
morning came with the last bustle and scurry, any
doubts that still lingered back in her mind were lost
in the glamour of the adventure whose day had at
last arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take &lsquo;The King of the Fairies&rsquo; with
me to read on the train, Mother,&rdquo; she called from her
bedroom where she was putting the very last things
into her bag.</p>
<p>Katherine came to stand in the doorway, a partly
spread piece of bread for a sandwich for Kate&rsquo;s
luncheon in her hand. &ldquo;But you know &lsquo;The King
of the Fairies&rsquo; by heart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why not take
the mystery story Sam and Lee gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve packed that. I believe you want &lsquo;The King
of the Fairies&rsquo; yourself, just as you want the picture!&rdquo;
Kate said, teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do. It&rsquo;s without exception the nicest
thing that has happened to us this year, I think.
Bring it back safely, for I shall certainly read it again
before the summer&rsquo;s through. Suppose we had been
so foolish as to decide we couldn&rsquo;t afford it that day
we stumbled on it in the bookshop and were lost at
the first paragraph!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Kate gasped at such a supposing. &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t
imagine having missed it, never read it, can you? If
that had happened, well, everything would be different.
It has made so many things different, hasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;reading
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for us both, I think. That&rsquo;s why I am sure
it is a great book, because it does make such a difference
to you, having read it or not. And I understand
your wanting it with you to-day. Try to get
Aunt Katherine to read it, if you can. She has
enough literary appreciation to realize its beauty, and
the rest of it, what it does to you&mdash;well, it wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt to have it do a little of that to her, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that minute Sam and Lee whistled from the
road, out at the back of the house, and in a second
they were around and in at the big front door calling
for Kate&rsquo;s bag and anything that was to be carried.
Katherine hurried to finish the sandwiches and tie up
the lunch, Kate gave her hair a last boyish, brisk
brushing, put on her hat, took her cape on her arm,
and they were off, hurrying down to Broad Street and
the bus there waiting the minute of starting in front
of the Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your father work Mother too hard on
that old catalogue,&rdquo; Kate besought the boys. &ldquo;And
do write me sometimes about everything, the tennis
court and all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Sam and Lee promised that they would take turns
writing, much as they disliked it, and Kate should not
lack for news. &ldquo;And bring Elsie back with you to
repay us,&rdquo; they commanded. &ldquo;The Hotel has let
us borrow the roller, and the court will be in fine
shape. We&rsquo;ll be all practised up, too. You&rsquo;d better
do some practising yourself while you&rsquo;re there. Elsie
is probably a shark, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the bus in good time and stood chattering
a few minutes before the bus driver facetiously
sang out, &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; Kate was the only passenger
that morning. One quick hug and kiss passed
between mother and daughter while Sam put in the
suitcase and Lee dropped &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo;
and the box of lunch in at the window. The busman
himself had climbed into his seat and was sitting with
his back to them. The Hotel piazza was deserted
for the minute. There was no one besides themselves
on the street. Sam kissed Kate on one cheek, and
Lee kissed her on the other, quick, sound, affectionate,
brotherly kisses. The driver blew his horn twice
just to make sure no traveller was belated in the
Hotel, started his engine, and the adventurer was off.</p>
<p>Kate stood in the little vestibule, hanging to the
door and looking back as long as she could see the
three people she was leaving. Katherine was between
the boys, hatless, in a blue smocked dress; she was
waving and blowing kisses. She looked like a sister to
the boys, and not even an older sister from the distance
of the speeding bus. Then the vehicle jerked
around a corner and Kate sat down, faced about the
way they were going, and contemplated her own immediate
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>In school she had often sat watching the big clock
over the blackboard in the front of the room; just
before the minute hand reached the hour it had a way
of suddenly jerking itself ahead with a little click.
That was what had happened on the instant of parting
from her mother&mdash;time, somehow, or at least her
place in time, had jerked suddenly and unexpectedly
ahead. Now the hour must be striking, she reflected
whimsically, and she was at the beginning of a new
one. So much the better. She expected it to be a
wholly fascinating hour, and Elsie the unknown
comrade was waiting in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE COMRADE DOES NOT APPEAR</span></h2>
<p>Although Kate kept her book &ldquo;The King of
the Fairies&rdquo; on her lap in bus and trains, she
did not look into its pages at all. Still it had its
meaning and its use on the journey. It was something
well known and dearly loved going with her into
strangeness and uncertainty. Its purple cloth binding
spoke to her through the tail of her eye even when
she was most busy taking in the fleeting landscape.
One would have thought her a seasoned traveller and
a very well-poised person if he had seen her sitting
so still, her hands lightly touching the closed book,
her gaze missing little of interest in country and town
as the train rushed along. But in reality her mind
was as busy as the spinning wheels, and her thoughts
ranged everywhere from the commonplace to the
inspired; and as for her emotions, they were in a whir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>But the thought that recurred over and over and
from which she never entirely escaped during the
whole five hours of travel was this: was any one else
in the world so happy and elated as she? People she
saw looking from windows, people working in factories,
people working in meadows, people walking on
streets&mdash;how dull and uneventful their present hour
was compared to her present hour! And the Hart
boys back at home! How could they bear the commonplaceness
of going on in the same spot all summer,
doing the same things, and seeing the same
people! And only one week ago she herself had been
more than contented, happily expectant even, when
she was facing just such a summer!</p>
<p>Of course, she wondered about Elsie a lot. In
fact, she scarcely thought of Great Aunt Katherine
at all. Would Elsie meet her at the South Station
in Boston? Great Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s letter had said
Elsie&rsquo;s maid would meet her. But surely Elsie herself
would be there, too. Kate, for a minute, imagined
herself in Elsie&rsquo;s place, eagerly waiting among the
crowds at the great terminal for the appearance of the
new friend, wondering and speculating about her,
just as Kate herself was wondering and speculating
about Elsie.</p>
<p>The journey seemed very short. Kate could not
believe they were actually in Boston until the conductor
coming through assured her that in less than
two minutes they would be in. But for Kate the
next two minutes seemed longer than all the rest
of the journey put together. She sat on the edge of
the seat, one hand grasping the handle of her suitcase,
the other clutching &ldquo;The King of the Fairies.&rdquo;
And even in her tense excitement the long-drawn-outness
of those two minutes made her think about
the King of the Fairies and what he had taught, or
rather shown, the girl and boy in the book about
<i>time</i>&mdash;what a mysterious thing it was, quite man-made
and not real. She could well believe it now.
However, even that two minutes came to an end, as
such eternities will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>At the train steps there were &ldquo;red caps&rdquo; galore
clamouring for baggage to carry, and a pushing crowd
of passengers who had poured down from the long
line of coaches. Kate shook her head as a matter
of course to the porters, and marched along, her
rather heavy leather bag, marked with the initials
K. M. in white chalk, in one hand, the book and her
purse&mdash;not a very good balance&mdash;in the other. No
one could come out into the train shed to meet you,
Kate remembered now from the two or three times
she had been in that station with her mother. Well,
Elsie would be up at the entrance, standing on tiptoes,
looking off over heads until their eyes met.
How should they know each other? No special
arrangement had been made to insure Kate&rsquo;s being
recognized. But Katherine had said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s not one to bungle anything. She
or Elsie or the maid, probably all three, will spot you
at once. And if they don&rsquo;t, all you have to do is to
find a telephone booth and call up the Oakdale
house.&rdquo; And now, coming up through the shed,
straining her eyes toward the gate, Kate had not the
slightest doubt that the minute her eyes met Elsie&rsquo;s
eyes they would know each other. She had lived
in anticipation of this minute now so steadily for so
long that she would feel confident of picking Elsie
out in a crowd of a thousand girls all of the same
age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>But she was getting near the gate and still she had
seen no one that might be Elsie. Then, walking on
tiptoes for a second, a difficult feat when you are as
loaded down as she was, she did see a girl standing a
little way back from the gate and watching the passengers
with impatient eagerness as they came
through. For an instant the eyes of the two girls
met. Kate went suddenly, unexpectedly shy at that
encounter. But instantly an inner Kate squared her
shoulders, in a way the inner Kate had, and forbade
the outer Kate to tremble. And when Kate, in a
flash, had restored herself to herself, she knew that
the girl waiting there was certainly not Elsie; she was
too utterly different from anything she had imagined
about her. There! She was right. The girl had
greeted the woman just ahead of Kate and they
hurried off together talking volubly. Kate drew a
relieved sigh. She never could have liked that overdressed
girl as well as she knew she was going to like
Elsie. They would never have become chums and
comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>But now she herself was outside the gate. She
suddenly realized that her suitcase was very heavy
and put it down. Simultaneously she looked around
confidently for a friendly, welcoming face, for the eyes
of the new comrade. There was no such face, no
such eyes. But she did become aware of a youngish
woman, in a very smart gray tailored suit and Parisian
looking black hat with a gray wing, bearing directly
down upon her. She was certainly too young
to be Great Aunt Katherine; but it was hard to believe
that such smartness and apparent distinction
could belong to a maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Marshall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Kate Marshall. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha, Miss Elsie&rsquo;s maid.&rdquo; She turned toward
a middle-aged round little Irishman in brown
livery. &ldquo;Timothy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s her.&rdquo; Alas, for
the distinction of the black toque!</p>
<p>Timothy stepped briskly forward and picked up
Kate&rsquo;s suitcase, touching his cap, but giving her a
quick, keenly interested glance at the same time.
&ldquo;Your trunk checks, if you please, Miss?&rdquo; he said,
holding out his free hand for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t a trunk. The suitcase is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the trunk catch this train?&rdquo; Bertha
asked, and added in a commiserating tone, &ldquo;Service
is wretched&mdash;Miss Frazier says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have any trunk at all. The suitcase
holds everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha&rsquo;s ejaculation of surprise was suddenly
turned into a flow of tactful words. &ldquo;All the better,
all the better. That makes things very simple, very
simple. We&rsquo;ve only to go out to the automobile
then, and we&rsquo;ll be in Oakdale in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Little round Timothy led the way with the bag and
book, Kate followed him, and Bertha came behind
her. She was not used to walking in processions like
this, and she felt distinctly strange and lonely. But
the thought that Elsie might be waiting in the car
braced her up. Even so she couldn&rsquo;t imagine why
Elsie hadn&rsquo;t come in and been the first to greet her
at the gate. If she were Elsie she would never sit
calmly waiting out in the car.</p>
<p>But the car was empty. It was a very handsome,
big, luxurious affair, painted a light glossy brown, the
very shade of Timothy&rsquo;s uniform. It had a long,
low body, much shining nickel plate, windshields before
the back seat as well as the front, and Great
Aunt Katherine Frazier&rsquo;s monogram in silver on the
door.</p>
<p>Timothy held back the monogrammed door while
Kate stepped in. Then he slid into the driver&rsquo;s seat,
leaving Bertha to follow him. So there was Kate
bobbing around on the wide back seat that was richly
though slipperily upholstered in smooth leather.
Her baggage was in front with the servants. She
had not even the cherished book to sustain her. She
wondered, a little whimsically, that they had let her
carry her purse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Where was Elsie? Kate gave herself up to speculation
as they crawled through the crowded city
streets. They crawled, but it was smooth and beautiful
crawling, for Timothy was an artist among chauffeurs.
Kate looked all around her interestedly and
happily in spite of the sharpness of her disappointment
at Elsie&rsquo;s absence. But although it was exciting
and stimulating to her to be moving through the
streets of the big city she realized the heat uncomfortably
and, used to her high hill air, was over-conscious
of the unsavoury odours that met her on every side.
She unbuttoned and threw back her cape and resisted
just in time an impulse to lift her hat from her
head by the crown, the way a boy does, and toss it
into a corner of the seat so that her head might be a
little cooler. But another inclination she did not
resist in time. She leaned forward and spoke to
Bertha over the windshield: &ldquo;Elsie, Miss Elsie,
couldn&rsquo;t she come? Is she well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>What an idiotic question! Why was she always
saying things so abruptly, things she hardly meant
to say! Bertha turned her smooth, distinguished-looking
profile. &ldquo;She is very well. She will be at
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they were out of the city and they gained
speed; but they gained almost without Kate&rsquo;s
noticing, for the car was so luxurious and Timothy
was such an artist. But when she observed how the
trees and fences and houses were beginning to rush
by she braced her feet against the nickel footrail and
laid her arm along the padded armrest. She leaned
back, relaxed. She began to feel that she quite belonged
in the car, as though such conveniences had
always been at her service, almost as though private
chauffeurs and ladies&rsquo; maids were an everyday
matter. Or was she dramatizing herself? Anyway,
it was fun and very, very new. She hoped there
would be time to write her mother all about it to-night.
She profoundly wished the Hart boys could
see her!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>But Bertha had turned her smooth profile again.
&ldquo;We are just entering Oakdale,&rdquo; she informed her,
speaking impersonally, so decorously that it might
have been to the air. And instantly Kate&rsquo;s composure
and assurance were shivered, her relaxed
muscles tensed themselves, her mind became just one
big question mark.</p>
<p>Oakdale was a charming suburb. Most of the
houses seemed to have lawns and gardens that justified
the name of &ldquo;grounds,&rdquo; and wealth spoke on
every side, but in a tone of good taste and often even
beauty. Elms and maples lined the street down
which the adventurer&rsquo;s chariot was bowling.</p>
<p>Oh, which house, which house was Great Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s? Would Elsie be standing in the doorway?
Would Kate know the house by that? Or
would she be at a window, or keeping a watch for
them on some garden wall?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>They suddenly swerved from the main residential
street and rolled down a delightful lane bordered by
older, more mellowed houses. At the very end of the
lane, before a large white house with green blinds, the
car came to a stop. What a gracious, dignified house
it was, and every bit as imposing and mansionlike as
Kate&rsquo;s mother had described it. There were balconies
gay with plants and hanging vines, tall windows, and
an absence of anything ambiguous or superfluous.
The wide front door, with its shining brass knocker
and rows of potted plants at either side, was approached
by a dozen or so wide, shallow stone stairs
bordered by tall blue larkspur and a golden bell-shaped
flower for which Kate did not know the
name. The steps were almost upon the lane, but
Kate knew that there were extensive &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; at
the back, and somewhere there the little orchard
house.</p>
<p>No Elsie stood at the top of those stone steps or
came running around the house from the gardens
at the sound of the stopping car. Not even Aunt
Katherine made an appearance. Timothy held open
the automobile door, Bertha took the suitcase and
book, and Kate, with a &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; to Timothy,
started off on the last stage of her journey, that of
the climb of the stone steps to her aunt&rsquo;s front door.
Bertha followed close behind. Kate wondered
whether she should ring the bell, or wait and let
Bertha ring it for her. Or would Bertha open the
door and they go in without ringing? Oh, dear!
Why hadn&rsquo;t she asked her mother more explicitly
about correct usage when there is a lady&rsquo;s maid at
your heels? But then, perhaps Mother couldn&rsquo;t
have helped her much, for certainly Mother had
never been so attended. And then the inner Kate
asserted herself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;How
can it matter which of you rings the doorbell?&mdash;and
certainly you&rsquo;re not going to go in without ringing.
Bertha&rsquo;s hands are too full either to ring the bell or
open the door. Ring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>But before her finger had time to reach the button,
the door swung open before her as though by magic
and Kate stepped in. A maid had opened the door
and now stood half-concealed behind it with her face
properly vacant. Kate, when she discovered her,
gave her a nod and a faint &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Then she
stood still in the hall, looking about for her aunt.
She had almost given up Elsie for the present; but
surely her aunt would come now from some part of
the house hurrying to greet her with hospitality and
show her her room.</p>
<p>But Bertha had no such idea. <i>She</i> did not look
about as though expecting any one. &ldquo;I will lead the
way,&rdquo; she offered, &ldquo;if you please. There are a good
many turns.&rdquo; And still carrying Kate&rsquo;s suitcase she
walked off up the narrow strip of thick gray velvety
material that carpeted the polished stairs. Kate followed.
It was a very complicated house, she decided,
as they went through doors, down unexpected passages,
up steps, and finally around a sharp turn, around
two turns, up two steps, and Bertha threw open a
door. There Bertha stood back for Kate to pass in
ahead of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The bedroom that had been assigned to her was
exquisitely lovely. It was a little room of beautiful
proportions facing the &ldquo;grounds.&rdquo; So much care
had been spent on its decorations and furnishings
that one never thought of all the money that had
been spent <i>with</i> the care. Its three long windows,
their sills almost on the floor, opened out on to a
flowery balcony hung above the garden. The windows
were wide open now because of the heat and
stood back against the walls like doors. The finest
of spiderweb lace was gathered against the panes,
and at their sides hung opal-coloured curtains of very
soft silk. The same colour, in heavier silk, was used
in the spread for the narrow ivory bed, with its
painted crimson ramblers at footboard and top.
There was a low reading table by the bed and in the
centre of it a little crystal lamp with an opal shade.
Across from the bed and table stood an ivory dressing
table reflecting the balcony&rsquo;s brilliant plants in its
three hinged mirrors. An ivory-coloured chair with
a low back and three legs was placed before the dressing
table. On one creamy wall hung LePage&rsquo;s &ldquo;Joan
of Arc,&rdquo; and on the opposite wall a painting of a little
girl with streaming hair leaping across a bright flower
bed. Through a door with long crystal mirrors
panelled into either side Kate glimpsed a white
bathroom with a huge porcelain tub with shining
taps and a rack hung thick with wide, creamy
towels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a heavenly room!&rdquo; she exclaimed, enraptured.
&ldquo;Is it mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is your bedroom.&rdquo; Bertha spoke almost
deprecatingly of it. &ldquo;But there is a sitting-room
just across the hall. It is Miss Elsie&rsquo;s, but while
you are here Miss Frazier says you are to share it.
That is much more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Kate went directly to a window, hoping to find
the orchard house in its view. She was not disappointed.
Beyond lawns and flower gardens there was
the old orchard with its gnarled, twisted trees, and
back among the trees the outlines of a little gray
house. Kate was quite moved by this her first
glimpse of her mother&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Bertha came up behind, and now was engaged in
unbuttoning her cape for her and taking off her hat.
But Kate was almost unconscious of these ministrations.
She was unconscious, too, when Bertha turned
to unpacking her bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be time for you to change to-night,
Miss Frazier said,&rdquo; Bertha was informing her. &ldquo;So
we&rsquo;ll just wash you up a bit and brush your hair.
Miss Frazier said you were to go down directly, and
there&rsquo;s the first gong anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A musical note was sounding through the house.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Kate turned from the window.
Bertha followed her into the bathroom, filled the
bowl for her with water, and then stood at hand with
soap and a towel. For one wild instant Kate wondered
whether Bertha meant to wash her face for her!
She had a definite feeling of relief when she put the
soap and the towel down at the side of the bowl and
left her alone. Quickly and efficiently Kate removed
the grime of travel. When she went back
into her room Bertha was standing by the dressing
table, brush in hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Kate sat down on the three-legged chair. She
thought she had never looked into clearer mirrors
than the three hinged ones before her. &ldquo;Please, I
can brush my own hair, it&rsquo;s so short. I would
rather.&rdquo; Just a few quick strokes, a poke or two, and
the bobbed hair with the wing brushed across the forehead
was perfectly tidy and crisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the top of the stairs,&rdquo; Bertha
offered. &ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t have noticed the way very
carefully as we came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not sure I could find it. But tell me
first, where does that door, the other door, in the
bathroom go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Miss Elsie&rsquo;s door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Elsie&rsquo;s room! So near! Oh, do you suppose
she&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. I dressed her for dinner before
starting to town for you. She&rsquo;s more probably
downstairs. Dinner is served three minutes after
that first gong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate gave one more glance toward the door that
now had become of so much interest to her, before
following Bertha. She was glad that she and Elsie
were to sleep so near each other. Why, it was a suite
of rooms they had. There was something splendid
about occupying a suite of rooms. And there was
even a sitting-room for them across the hall. How
jolly it was and how independent! But where was
Elsie?</p>
<p>Kate thanked Bertha when she had been guided to
the top of the staircase. &ldquo;Am I just to go down?&rdquo;
she asked, a little timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Miss Frazier will be in the drawing-room.
It&rsquo;s at the left. You can&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha faded discreetly back as she spoke, into the
shadows of the upper hall, leaving Kate suddenly to
her own resources. But after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation,
during which the inner indomitable Kate was summoned
up, she passed quietly and with dignity down
the gray velvet stair carpet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LITTLE ORCHARD HOUSE, BEWARE!</span></h2>
<p>The drawing-room extended for almost half the
length of the big house. It was the largest room
that Kate had ever seen or imagined outside of a
castle. Just at first she could not discover her aunt
in it. But soon her glance found her sitting down at
the farthest end near one of the French doors that
stood wide open into the garden. Her head was
turned away, but the shape and pose of that head
and the way she sat in her chair, with a book but not
reading, reminded Kate sharply and poignantly of
her mother. Why hadn&rsquo;t Katherine warned her
that they were so much alike?</p>
<p>She went toward her softly because of her shyness,
her feet hardly making a sound on the Persian rugs,
past the tables and divans and lamps. It was seven
o&rsquo;clock of a July evening now, and the shadows lent
a lovely charm to the big room that was peculiarly
charming even in broadest daylight. Kate felt as
she went toward her aunt that she was walking in a
dream. And it was a very nice dream, too, for that
glimpse of the likeness of her aunt to her mother had
reassured her completely. All her previous ideas
of her aunt were swept away, and the anticipations
of this visit, which for a little had been dampened,
now returned with fresh life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Miss Frazier turned as Kate came near. Hastily
she put her book, still open as Kate&rsquo;s mother would
have, on a table at her hand and rose. She kissed
Kate with warmth and dignity and then held her off,
the tips of her fingers on her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one bit like your mother,&rdquo; she affirmed.
&ldquo;Not one least bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t accuse me,&rdquo; Kate said, laughing. &ldquo;I
would have been if I could, of course. But wouldn&rsquo;t
it have been rather confusing to have had three of us
so much alike? The names are confusing enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If someone could have told Kate an hour&mdash;no, two
minutes&mdash;ago that on first meeting her aunt she
would speak so easily, so without self-consciousness,
she would not have believed. She had expected to
be constrained, awkward. But then she had never
expected Aunt Katherine to be so agreeable as she
apparently was.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine was smiling quite brilliantly.
Kate had instantly touched and pleased her. &ldquo;Does
it really seem to you that I am anything like your
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Kate nodded. But even as she nodded, she saw
the difference suddenly. Aunt Katherine was taller,
of course; but that was not it. Her firm, squarish
chin was not neutralized by melting gray eyes as
Katherine&rsquo;s was. Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s eyes were dark
and their expression echoed the strong chin; it was a
sure expression, penetrating and above all intellectual.
And the lines about the mouth and eyes were lines
that Katherine would never have at any age. They
were lines of loneliness and trouble.</p>
<p>Even as Kate was thinking all this&mdash;lightning-quick
thinking it was, of course&mdash;she saw the lines
deepen and the mouth and eyes harden perceptibly.
&ldquo;It is past dinner time. Didn&rsquo;t Elsie come down
with you?&rdquo; The hardening was not for Kate&rsquo;s
tardiness; it was for Elsie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her. I don&rsquo;t believe she was in her
room or she would have heard me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen Elsie? That is strange! She must
be in the orchard or somewhere, and not realize the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine moved to the garden door, her
hand still on Kate&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;There she comes
now, from the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stepped over the sill and waited for Elsie on
the stone flags outside. She was floating through the
gardens directly from the orchard. Floating is a
better word for it than hurrying because she was such
a light and airy creature and above all so graceful.
Her approach was almost in the nature of a dance.
She was dressed in white, a narrow belt of periwinkle
blue at the low waistline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>It was evident when she came nearer that she had
not seen the two waiting for her. Her eyes were
dropped a little and she was smiling! There was a
radiance of happiness about her. At first, in this
impression of her, happiness was even more obvious
than prettiness. But she was pretty, too, quite enchantingly
pretty. Kate, who was not pretty herself,
loved it all the more in others. Her appreciation
always leapt to meet it.</p>
<p>Elsie was slim, with a fairy grace of face and figure.
Her hair, a net of sunlight even now in the growing
dusk, was tied at her neck, and its curls straying on
her shoulders and at her cheeks shone like fairy gold.
Her face was delicately moulded and faintly tinted.
It was her chin that struck Kate most. It was an
elfin, whimsically pointed chin. In fact, she was such
an exquisite creature that Kate, standing there waiting
for the instant when she should look up and their
eyes meet, felt as though her own sturdy young body
belonged to another world.</p>
<p>But Elsie was so absorbed in her happiness that
she did not raise her eyes until she was almost
upon them. It was Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s voice that recalled
her, and she stopped short a few feet from
where they were standing. &ldquo;Well, Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then at last the eyes of the destined comrades
met! Kate was smiling, the corners of her mouth
uptilted little wings. Her whole face spoke her delight
in Elsie&rsquo;s extraordinary prettiness and her
own expectation of comradeship. No one could have
missed what her look meant. But Elsie&rsquo;s response
was a strange one. Instantly the elfin smile vanished,
the elfin chin became set, the pretty face and
violet eyes hardened. But she took the few remaining
steps forward and gave Kate her hand.
In a correctly polite but delicately cool way she said,
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine showed some chagrin at that tone.
&ldquo;This is your cousin, Elsie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not
going to stand on any formality with a cousin who
has come for the express purpose of being cousinly.
Dinner was announced some minutes ago. Let us go
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what had happened to Kate? She hardly
knew herself. She had turned sick, physically sick
and faint, when Elsie had looked at her so coolly and
indifferently. No one had ever treated her so in all
her life before. She had had spats, of course, with
her contemporaries, now and then. There had been
days when either Sam or Lee or some girl in school
refused to speak to her. There had been angry
glances, sharp words. But she had never been
treated like this. Nothing before had ever turned
her <i>sick</i>.</p>
<p>As they moved down the long drawing-room and
across the hall to the dining-room Kate asked herself
desperately whether she had imagined it all. Could
she have heard Elsie&rsquo;s voice aright? Was the cool,
hard glance from Elsie&rsquo;s eyes insultingly indifferent?
How could it be? Why should it be? What had
she done? She had done just nothing at all. There
was no reason in the world for Elsie to hate or despise
her. And so, fortified by her reason and by the wise
inner Kate that never wholly forsook her, Kate
decided before they reached the dining-room that
it <i>had</i> been imagination&mdash;partly, anyway. Elsie
might not have liked her looks at first, but she had
no reason to hate her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Even so, she did not have the courage to look directly
at Elsie when they were finally seated at the
table. They were in high-backed carved Italian
chairs at a narrow, long, black, much-oiled table. In
the centre of the table two marvellously beautiful
water lilies floated in an enormous shallow jade
bowl. The napkin that Kate half unfolded in
her lap was monogrammed damask and very luxurious
to her fingers&rsquo; touch. The dinner was simple,
as simple as the dinners to which Kate was accustomed
at home, but it was served with such
dignity by a lacy-capped and aproned waitress that
before they were finished with the prune-whip dessert
Kate felt they had banqueted.</p>
<p>Very early in the meal Kate learned that she need
not avoid looking directly at Elsie, for Elsie&rsquo;s own
eyes were averted. Apparently she was languidly
interested in the portraits on the opposite wall. At
any rate, her gaze was always just a little above
Kate&rsquo;s head or to the right or left of her shoulder.
When Aunt Katherine spoke to her she looked at her
as she replied. But aside from those polite and
clearly spoken answers, she contributed nothing to
the conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>In contrast to Elsie Aunt Katherine was giving
her whole mind to being entertaining and making
Kate feel at home. She drew her out about the life
in Ashland, the barn that had so ingeniously been
turned into a house, Kate&rsquo;s school in Middletown,
the Hart boys, their mother and father, the life at
Ashland College, everything that concerned Katherine
and Kate. Although Kate hardly realized it,
during the course of that first meal she had given
her aunt a pretty complete picture of her background,
and incidentally of herself.</p>
<p>Just as the finger bowls were brought in Aunt
Katherine said, &ldquo;The little orchard house beyond the
garden was your Grandfather Frazier&rsquo;s, you know,
Kate. You will want to explore it, I imagine.
To-morrow at breakfast I shall give you the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was delighted. &ldquo;Oh, may I go into it?
Mother wasn&rsquo;t at all sure it wouldn&rsquo;t be rented.
She wanted me to see it if I possibly could, and tell
her all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s not rented. It is too much part
of my grounds, altogether too connected with everything
here. A family there would be intolerable.
And besides, I consider that the house belongs to
your mother. It is only waiting for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the eyes of the two girls did meet for the
second time. Kate gasped. Fear and anger spoke
in Elsie&rsquo;s direct stare. And Kate was sure she was
not imagining now&mdash;all the delicate tint had been
swept from Elsie&rsquo;s face. She was pale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>They got up at that minute and followed Aunt
Katherine from the dining-room. Elsie turned her
head away as they walked. But Kate was too
curious now to be definitely unhappy. She wanted
only to know the reason of Elsie&rsquo;s behaviour. And
she surprised herself more than a little by finding
herself drawn to the sulky, ungracious, frightened
girl. Nothing was at all the way she had dreamed
it and expected it, it is true. But in some ways it
was better. Elsie was more of a <i>person</i> than her
dreams had made her, and friendship with her, if
only they ever did become friends, might be quite
wonderful. Kate did not think this out. It was
just her feeling.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room Aunt Katherine sat down
at her reading table and picked up her book. &ldquo;It
is after eight,&rdquo; she told the girls, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure
Kate should go to bed early. But you may walk
in the garden together a little first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Kate glimpsed the Aunt Katherine of tradition.
Neither she nor Elsie had any thought but
to obey the command. They went out together to
walk in the garden. &ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; Kate said
to herself, inwardly smiling. But there was no
rebellion in her thought. She distinctly liked Aunt
Katherine and was ready to take commands from her.
And this command was particularly welcome. Now
Elsie <i>must</i> unbend! Now they must find each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>For a minute they walked in silence and then
Kate said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the apple orchard. I want
to see my mother&rsquo;s house nearer. Do you know I
can hardly wait until morning when I shall see it
inside, too. Mother has told me so much about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t your mother&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Elsie answered
quite unexpectedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s. And
there&rsquo;s nothing to see in the dark. Just a little old
gray house with weeds in the front walk. Even the
road to it is all grown over with grass now, for no
one goes there ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see it all the same. It&rsquo;s where my
mother and my grandmother and my grandfather
lived. I&rsquo;m going whether you come or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Elsie acquiesced, sulkily. &ldquo;But
a lot you&rsquo;ll see in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just as Elsie had said. It was a little old
gray house set down in the centre of the apple orchard
with no road leading to it. And weeds stood
high in the gravel front walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a fairy house by starlight!&rdquo; Kate exclaimed,
quite forgetting Elsie&rsquo;s mood in her own.</p>
<p>Elsie spoke in a rather high voice then, a voice
that carried all through the orchard: &ldquo;If it is a fairy
house,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;Fairies, beware! Orchard
house, beware! If there are fairies in the house put
out all lights, hurry away. Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s nieces
are here and Aunt Katherine doesn&rsquo;t want the house
occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Kate was surprised but quickly pleased, too. Elsie
had entered into a game whole-heartedly. Perhaps
she was just an ordinary girl, after all! Perhaps she
had been imagining absurd things about her. This
Elsie calling out into the starry dimness, warning
the little house of their approach, was Elsie as
she should be, with her fairy-gold curls and elfin
chin.</p>
<p>Kate involuntarily drew nearer to her. And then
she raised her voice and called in her turn to the
little orchard house. &ldquo;But Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s not
here,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;She is deep in a deep book.
So light all your lights, if you wish, look out of your
windows, open your doors. Little enchanted house,
wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was laughing as she finished and holding Elsie&rsquo;s
hand, for she was quite carried away by her own
fancy. This was the kind of nonsense she loved, and
the little house did seem alive and awake. She <i>felt</i>
it responding there in its dim starlight!</p>
<p>Elsie allowed her hand to be held. But she cried,
softly, but still in a carrying voice, &ldquo;No, no, no.
Don&rsquo;t look out! Don&rsquo;t wake up. There are two of
us here. Two. Not one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the girls stood silent. The game had
become so real that Kate would not have been at all
astonished to see fairy lights at the windows, to hear
windows opening and fairy laughter. But she heard
nothing except the crickets in the uncut grass and
Elsie&rsquo;s hurried breathing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go all around the
house&rdquo;&mdash;and off she started, still holding Elsie&rsquo;s
hand. Elsie could only go, too. And at the back
of the house, the side that was in view only of the
orchard and vacant fields beyond, Kate noticed two
windows wide open in the second story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Aunt Katherine let those windows stay open
like that?&rdquo; she asked, curiously. &ldquo;Those are the windows
in the study. I know from Mother&rsquo;s telling.
Suppose it should rain to-night? It must be an
oversight. Let&rsquo;s go back and get the key from
Aunt Katherine now to-night and close them for
her. Won&rsquo;t it be fun to go in by starlight, just we
two alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head violently and pulled her hand
away at the same time. There was a break in her
voice almost as though she were in danger of bursting
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go being a busybody the very first
hour you are here,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I guess Aunt
doesn&rsquo;t need your advice about such things. Come
away. Come out of the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate followed her, nonplussed, at sea. &ldquo;What
is the matter?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;What are you
afraid of, Elsie Frazier?&rdquo; Then, stopping suddenly,
&ldquo;What was that? Listen!&rdquo; Surely a door had
closed softly up there in the room with the windows
open!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course I didn&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A door closed up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! How could a door close up there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did. I heard it just as plain. But perhaps
it was a breeze that closed it. Only I don&rsquo;t feel
any breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a <i>careful</i> breeze. It shut the door
ever so gently. Quite as though a door knob was
turned. Oh, Elsie, do you suppose it is fairies&mdash;or
something weird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anything. And Aunt Katherine
will be expecting us in. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went Kate turned to look back several
times at the orchard house. But no fairy lights
twinkled for her in the windows, no doors or windows
opened, no fairy stood on the doorstone beckoning
her back. It was just a little old gray house in an
orchard. But even so Kate felt it <i>alive</i>, awake
somehow. Elsie could not spoil her feeling about it.</p>
<p>Just outside the lighted drawing-room Elsie turned
about and faced Kate. She was not quite so tall
and she was slighter. But her whole body was
drawn up with extraordinary force and her face, in
spite of its delicate elfin quality, was determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate Marshall,&rdquo; she said in a quiet tone, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
not to say one word to Aunt Katherine about those
windows. Not one single word! And what&rsquo;s more,
you&rsquo;re not to use the key that she will give you to-morrow.
It&rsquo;s not your mother&rsquo;s house any more.
You&rsquo;ll only be disappointed. There&rsquo;s nothing of
her in there at all. I shall hate you and hate you
and HATE you if you use that key. You&rsquo;ve got to
promise me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Kate did not flinch before this unexpected attack.
But she was amazed. &ldquo;Of course I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t promise
you,&rdquo; she contradicted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a silly to think
you can make me. What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie still looked at her, but her firmness, her
determination melted. Her lips trembled. Unshed
tears glistened in her eyes. When she spoke her
tone was changed completely. &ldquo;Please, please,&rdquo;
she besought Kate. &ldquo;You are just a girl even if you
are&mdash;well, even if you are Kate Marshall. Please
promise me that you&rsquo;ll wait a week before exploring
the orchard house. After that I won&rsquo;t care. Go
and live in it, if you like. But just for a week,
promise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo; But Kate was softening.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise. But perhaps, since you care so
much, I won&rsquo;t go in to-morrow or the next day. Perhaps
I&rsquo;ll stay away a week. Only I think you&rsquo;ll have
to tell me <i>why</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elsie shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you why.
You&rsquo;ll know for yourself within a few days. You&rsquo;ve
promised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not promised. And I think you ought
to explain to me. Are you sure you won&rsquo;t? I&rsquo;m a
pretty good person at keeping a secret. If I knew,
I <i>might</i> promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head. Kate saw the tears still
glistening in her eyes. She felt brutal to have made
a fairy cry!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she begged softly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
use the key to-morrow, anyway. I promise you
that. And I&rsquo;ll tell you before I do use it. I don&rsquo;t
see why I shouldn&rsquo;t put it off for a week if you care
so much. I&rsquo;m not a pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t even prowl around the orchard
house during that week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate, instantly forgetting her momentary pity,
grew hot. &ldquo;I never prowl. What a nasty word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You prowled to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. We were playing a game with the
house. I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With high-held head, flaming cheeks, and bright
eyes Kate stepped into the drawing-room. Elsie
was at her side, cool, calm, no trace of recent tears.
In spite of Kate&rsquo;s flash of real anger Elsie was well
satisfied with the outcome of their &ldquo;walk in the
garden.&rdquo; For she felt that Kate would be one to
keep her word. Elsie might breathe freely, for a
day more at any rate, and not live in hourly terror of
the discovery of her secret, and the secret of the
orchard house.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine had been watching them through
the glass of the long door. She smiled, apparently
well pleased, as they came in now. She said, &ldquo;I am
glad that you are getting acquainted. You should
have a very nice month together, you two. Kate
must be tired, and I advise you both to go right to
bed. Breakfast is at quarter to eight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;She was watching us while we talked at the
door,&rdquo; Elsie whispered as they went up the stairs.
&ldquo;She thought we couldn&rsquo;t leave off talking. She
imagines we&rsquo;re bosom friends already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate walked on up with a set face. She did
not trouble to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KATE MAKES UP A FACE</span></h2>
<p>As they neared their doors Elsie said, &ldquo;Please
tell Bertha if she&rsquo;s in your room that I shall be
in the sitting-room when she&rsquo;s through helping you.
I&rsquo;m going right to bed then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped with her hand on the knob. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
you like to see the sitting-room? It&rsquo;s yours, too,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked in as Elsie opened the door and stood
back. Now she knew why Bertha had said that
room was more &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; than her bedroom.
In contrast to it her bedroom was almost nun-like.
There were deep chairs upholstered in gay cretonne,
cretonne with parrots and poppies and birds of
paradise glowing against its yellow background.
There was even a little lounge, heaped with yellow
pillows, drawn up under the windows. In the centre
of the room stood a square cherry-wood reading
table, and the walls were almost lined with bookshelves
already about one third filled with books.
On the table stood a glass bowl filled with red roses.
A Japanese floor lamp cast a mellow light over
everything. In one corner a practical old Governor
Winthrop desk with many drawers and a wide
writing leaf drew Kate&rsquo;s eyes. Imagine having a
desk like that just for one&rsquo;s own!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>But she did not show her appreciation of the room.
She simply glanced about it, as Elsie seemed to expect
her to, and then muttering a crusty &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;
crossed the hall to her own room.</p>
<p>Bertha was waiting for her there. Evidently
Aunt Katherine had instructed her that Kate would
retire early. The opal lamp by the bed was shedding
its delicate radiance through the room, the bed was
turned down, Kate&rsquo;s dressing gown and nightgown
were spread across its foot, and her bedroom slippers
stood near at hand. Her bag had long since been
unpacked and put away. The &ldquo;King of the Fairies&rdquo;
and the mystery story&mdash;Sam and Lee&rsquo;s gift&mdash;lay on
the bed table under the lamp.</p>
<p>Kate was very glad of her own cool, clear little
room. She liked it better than all that colour and
ease across the hall. And in any case she would
never be able to share that other room with Elsie.
She determined not to go into it at all&mdash;no, not even
to look over the books!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Elsie is in the sitting-room,&rdquo; she told Bertha.
&ldquo;She said to tell you that when you were ready she
would go to bed. I don&rsquo;t need any help, truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I even brush your hair, Miss Kate?
That is so restful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve unpacked for me. Thank you very
much. My short hair doesn&rsquo;t need much brushing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>So, reluctantly, for Miss Frazier had requested her
to attend to both girls equally, Bertha took her dismissal.
In a minute Kate heard voices on the other
side of Elsie&rsquo;s door. Then Elsie opened the door and
looked in through the bathroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Katherine says we&rsquo;re to leave these doors
open,&rdquo; she informed Kate, calmly. &ldquo;That is so
you won&rsquo;t be lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate nodded an &ldquo;all right.&rdquo; But to herself she
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a heap less lonely if you&rsquo;d close the
door and I&rsquo;d never see your face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She undressed well out of sight of Elsie&rsquo;s room.
When she was in nightgown, dressing robe, and slippers,
she sat down on the three-legged ivory stool,
before the hinged mirrors, brush in hand. She was
surprised by the expression of her own face as it
looked back at her grimly out of the glass. All its
humour, its <i>charm</i>, was gone. She was just a rather
plain young girl. And as she looked at this disenchanted
reflection it suddenly went misty and
blurred. She saw tears rising in its eyes.</p>
<p>With an angry hand she dashed them away and
stuck out her tongue at the blurred face in the
mirror. Then came her own laugh, the eyes crinkling
to slits, the mouth freed from its set lines and
lifting wings in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;To cry about her!
She&rsquo;s a stuck-up little pig, but you needn&rsquo;t become
a grouchy glum just for that. Be yourself in spite
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>But as she went toward the windows to push them
a little farther back, for the night was a warm and
beautiful one, she turned her head and looked
through the open doors into Elsie&rsquo;s room. Elsie
was sitting before her own dressing table, a replica of
Kate&rsquo;s. She was in an exquisitely soft-looking pink
dressing gown edged about the neck and the long
flowing sleeves with swansdown. Bertha stood behind
her, brushing her curls with long, even strokes.
The eyes of the two girls met in Elsie&rsquo;s glass. Flashingly,
Kate was glad she had made up a face and got
it over with; otherwise she would certainly have made
up just the same face now, at Elsie, before thinking.</p>
<p>The pairs of eyes held each other in the glass for
an instant. It must have been something deceiving
in the twin lights glowing at either side of Elsie&rsquo;s
mirror, or in the glass itself, Kate decided afterward,
but for that instant it seemed that a <i>comrade</i>
had looked questioningly out of the mirror at her!
But the hidden comrade, if such it was, vanished even
before Kate had time to turn away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>What a delicious bed Aunt Katherine had given
her! She delighted in its scented linen and light covers.
She punched the fluffy pillows up into a bolster,
slipped out of her dressing gown and in between the
smooth, lavender-scented sheets. Sitting there
against the pillows she took &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo;
on to her knee. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep quite yet,
she knew. Why, at home she seldom went to bed
before her mother, and now it was not yet nine.
The very sight, even the feeling of this book in her
hands filled her with a happy stir deep in the far wells
of imagination. She opened it casually. Any place
would do since she already knew it practically by
heart. The very sight of the smooth, clearly printed
pages with their wide margins freed her. She was
ready for space now and clear, disentangled adventurings
into light.</p>
<p>Although the book was titled &ldquo;The King of the
Fairies&rdquo; it was not at all a fairy story for children.
Kate had only just reached the age when it could
be cared about. It began with a girl and a boy
quarrelling on a fence in a meadow. It was a real
quarrel, a horrid quarrel with hot and sharp and
bitter words. But it is interrupted by a tramp happening
by. He asks them a direction and they stop
their recriminations for the time to point him his
way scornfully. Accepting their directions he still
tarries a while to ask them if they themselves don&rsquo;t
want some pointing. Then the story, the marvellous
story begins. He points to an elder bush and
asks them what it is. They tell him glibly. Then
he gets on to the fence between them and with his
eyes level with theirs asks them to look again.
Everything is changed for the girl and boy in that
instant. They begin seeing as the tramp sees.
They are in Paradise or Fairyland: the author himself
makes no clear distinction. But the elder bush
is now much more than an elder bush. And the meadow
is full of a life the girl and boy had never suspected.
There are other beings moving in it, fairy
beings, perhaps. Not only is the invisible made
visible to the girl and boy seeing as the tramp sees,
but the, until then at least, partly visible&mdash;the brook,
the trees, the very stones and the elder bush&mdash;are
seen to have more <i>life</i> than could be suspected.
And all colours are changed, too. The boy and girl
are seeing things in a new spectrum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Finally the three get down from the fence and
wander about in this Fairyland that has always been
here truly but is only now seen. The book is their
day in the meadow. And when you have turned the
last page you do not remember it as a <i>book</i>. You
remember it as a day in Fairyland or Paradise&mdash;or
as a day on which you saw things clear. And you
never doubt for a minute that the author himself
is one who has certainly seen like that. Perhaps
he only saw it in a flash, but he did see for himself and
with his own eyes.</p>
<p>In the end the boy and girl return to the fence and
the tramp departs on the way they had pointed out
to him. But as he goes, he turns about when he
gets to the elder bush and they realize in that last
glance from his eyes that he is the King of the
Fairies. Then as he turns again and walks on, as
long as he is in their sight, he is simply a common
tramp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>But their quarrel has dropped for ever dead between
them. A boy and a girl who have actually
walked in Fairyland together and seen things clear
have nothing to quarrel about, and so long as they
both shall live can have nothing to quarrel about
again.</p>
<p>And though they had surely seen things clear for
a whole day in the meadow&mdash;the sun had risen to
the meridian and gone down into the west while
they wandered&mdash;now when they look at each other
there is no indication that a minute has passed.
The sun is where it was at the height of their quarrel!
And so it appears that the tramp&rsquo;s arrival and stay
and departure and their whole day in the meadow
was squeezed into perhaps one straight meeting of
their eyes as they quarrelled.</p>
<p>But they do not spend themselves in wonder.
This boy and girl are Wisdom&rsquo;s own children, in
spite of the momentary silliness that had plunged
them head-first into the darkness of an enmity; they
accept the gods&rsquo; gifts. And for a boy and a girl
who have spent a day in Fairyland together, or for
that matter only spent a minute there together, the
gods&rsquo; gift is marriage.</p>
<p>Katherine, when she had finished the book, had
said that it was the most perfect love story she had
ever read; she wished she were rich enough to give
it to all the lovers she knew. And she said, too, that
the author must be a very wonderful person, a
great man in some field of life. Perhaps that was
why he had not signed his name to the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>As Kate read now, the conversation between
Elsie and Bertha in the next room was a humming
undertone to her thoughts. She could not have
caught their words if she had listened. But she had
no inclination to listen. She was moving in a world
where quarrels and bitter feelings were an impossibility.
She was seeing things through the eyes
of the King of the Fairies. She was in the meadows
that she knew at home, feeling the larger life there
that the King of the Fairies had made known to her.
She was standing, tall, in the body of an elm tree,
spreading with its leaves to the sun, feeling with its
roots into the vibrating ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice came to her. It was a long way
she rushed back to find the voice. Bertha was
standing beside her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I turn out your light, Miss Kate? Or do
you wish to read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did not know that Bertha had come into the
room at all. Elsie&rsquo;s light was out, and if the doors
through must be left open, Kate&rsquo;s light would disturb
her. Of course she must put out her light and
try to sleep. She was on the verge of saying, &ldquo;I
will put out my own light, thanks,&rdquo; but the meadow
from which she had rushed back had, oddly enough
as some might think, put her into more perfect harmony
with her own restricted four walls. So she
said, &ldquo;You may put the light out, thank you.&rdquo;
And she did not even smile to herself when Bertha
bent over the table and pulled at the little chain
that was much nearer Kate&rsquo;s reach than hers.
She accepted the service naturally, since such acceptance
was Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s wish and the purpose
of Bertha&rsquo;s presence here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; Bertha spoke out of the sudden
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; Kate answered. Then soft footfalls,
and she was alone in the room.</p>
<p>But though &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo; had done a
good deal for Kate it had not had time to do enough
to make her call a &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; to Elsie. Suppose
Aunt Katherine knew the two girls were going to
sleep without a word to each other!</p>
<p>From her bed, now that the room was dark, Kate
could see the dim apple orchard under starlight.
She rose on her elbow and strained her eyes for the
outlines of the little orchard house. She found it
by hard looking. How mysterious, how lonely, still
how alive out there it stood. And she <i>had</i> heard a
door close softly, just as though a door knob had
turned as they stood below those open back windows.
And why were those windows open? Elsie knew,
Kate was sure. The little orchard house harboured
some secret of Elsie&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>But what was that! Kate sat up in bed and bent
toward the window, her eyes straining. A light,
flickering, was moving down through the house!
Kate watched it as it went by several windows,
breathless. Soon it disappeared altogether, and a
second after Kate thought she heard the front door
of the little orchard house softly closing, or opening;
but that must have been fancy, for the orchard
house was much too far away for a sound of that
quality to carry to her.</p>
<p>As she curled down into bed again her eyes crinkled
with her smile in the darkness. Well, here was
mystery. She would write Sam and Lee that she
would save their mystery story for duller times.
Now she was living in one!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;I WILL PAY FOR IT&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Kate was waked next morning by Elsie moving
about in her room. She opened her eyes quickly
and sat up. To her surprise Elsie was dressed and
ready for the day. She looked as fresh as the July
morning in a blue and white gingham, white sport
shoes and stockings. Her hair was pinned up at
her ears, and that made her look older but not less
pretty than last night.</p>
<p>Kate was not a girl to wake up with a grudge on a
morning like this, or on any morning, in fact. So
she sang out now, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elsie, apparently, had not been mellowed by
sleep. She responded to the &ldquo;hello&rdquo; with a nod.
Then, much to Kate&rsquo;s surprise, she came directly
to the bed and picked up &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo;
from the table there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha told me you had borrowed my book,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your borrowing books. But I
think you ought to ask. And Aunt Katherine didn&rsquo;t
give me this one. I&rsquo;m going to read outdoors before
breakfast, and I want &lsquo;The King of the Fairies,&rsquo;
if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Kate laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my copy, not yours,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Mother and I gave it to each other last
Easter. It&rsquo;s a perfectly great book, Mother thinks,
and I brought it with me here because I love it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie was standing directly in the gilded morning
sunlight. Kate had just waked up and her eyes
were still a little dazed from sleep. That may account
for her seeing again, flashingly, the comrade
she had surprised in the mirror last night. Surely
Elsie&rsquo;s whole being in that flash radiated comradeship.
And there was something more. Kate could
not remember, but sometime in her life&mdash;it felt a
long time ago&mdash;she had exchanged glances with that
golden comrade! Or had it been just a vivid dream
she had had, or perhaps only the ideal she had set
up in her mind of the perfect comrade?</p>
<p>But Elsie almost instantly moved out of the sunlight
nearer the bed, and everything was as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please pardon me,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why it never entered my head that you might
have a copy of your own. That was stupid of me.
I&rsquo;ll see you at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it is still on,&rdquo; Kate told herself, as Elsie left
the room. &ldquo;She hates me. She hates me just
awfully. And that was awfully rude about the book,
even if it had been hers! How <i>could</i> she be so rude&mdash;to
a <i>guest?</i> She is afraid of me, too. She is afraid
I will discover the secret of the orchard house.
Why, perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t hate me, personally at all.
Mayn&rsquo;t it be just fear that makes her like that?
For she has no reason to hate me, and of course if
she has some secret in the orchard house she has
every reason to think I may discover it. For I do
mean to explore it thoroughly when I get around to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the conviction she had come to, that fear
rather than personal dislike was ruling Elsie&rsquo;s conduct,
comforted her. Moreover, it was a perfect
morning&mdash;sunshine, a light breeze at the curtains,
birds carolling (how had she ever slept through the
noise those birds were making?) and the room
pervaded by flower scents from balcony and gardens.
It was with a light heart, then, that Kate
allowed Bertha to run her bath, lay out her clothes,
and finally even brush the bobbed hair. Such unneeded
service seemed absurd to Kate, but it was in
the order of this household, and some fresh sweetness
she had brought from sleep made her eager to harmonize
herself as much as possible with the world
she had come back to. But even so, in a minute
when Bertha&rsquo;s back was turned, Kate grabbed the
brush from the dressing table and gave a quick,
surreptitious stroke that turned the bang Bertha
had created into a wing across her brows; for Bertha,
experienced lady&rsquo;s maid as she was, had not caught
the knack of <i>that</i> so quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>It was with a heart as bright as the morning that
Kate finally went down the long stairs just as the
soft-toned gong was sounding. There was no sign
of breakfast being laid in the dining-room, so she
wandered about the house, in and out of the rooms
she had only glimpsed through open doors last
night.</p>
<p>Everything was quite beautiful. Kate knew that
Aunt Katherine had once been determined to &ldquo;go in
for art seriously.&rdquo; But at that time money had been
lacking for such a design, and she had with keen
disappointment submitted to fate and become a
school teacher. When wealth had suddenly come
to her everyone thought she would, of course, take
up study with some great master and become an
artist. But this never came about. Perhaps the first
disappointment had been too keen; perhaps in giving
up her hope so definitely she had made it impossible
for herself ever to renew it under any conditions.
But now, wandering about these rooms that Aunt
Katherine had made, Kate realized that she had
turned artist in a way. Instead of painting on
canvas she had created beauty in her environment.
For her home was like a warmly painted picture with
beautiful lights and shadows. And Kate soon felt
as though she were walking around in a picture.
The morning sunshine outside was its great gilded
frame. That was how the utter silence and absence
of human beings in these big downstairs rooms
explained itself to her fancy; somehow she had walked
into a picture painted by her great aunt, a picture
hung up somewhere in an enormous gilded frame.
This fancy stirred her imagination and she pretended
so hard to herself that it became quite real.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>That is why she almost started when she finally
did hear voices and the clink of china. Coming
out of the picture into everyday life, suddenly like
that, was something of a jar. And she was probably
late for breakfast wherever it was being served.
She hurried her steps and found Aunt Katherine and
Elsie already at the meal. They were sitting at a
little table under a peach tree growing up between
the flags of a terrace just outside a sunny breakfast-room.
How delightful! Kate was glad now to step
down out of the picture.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine greeted her with a welcoming
smile. And having just stepped down out of Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s picture Kate felt that she understood
her, that they were very close to each other really.
How different, and how pleasantly different, Great
Aunt Katherine was proving herself from Kate&rsquo;s
preconceived ideas of her.</p>
<p>Kate took the little garden chair waiting for her
and unfolded her napkin. Coffee was percolating
visibly in two large glass globes set one on top of the
other before Aunt Katherine. The silver sugar bowl
and cream pitcher turned all the sunlight that found
them into a million diamond sparkles. A half grapefruit
with ice snuggled about it was at Kate&rsquo;s place.
Kate lifted the slender pointed spoon made just
for grapefruit, and gratefully tasted the tart pulp
and juice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie might have shown you the way,&rdquo; Aunt
Katherine was saying. &ldquo;I thought of course you
would come down together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I was late. But it was fun wandering
around in the house trying to find you.&rdquo; And then
Kate told them all about how she had felt herself in a
picture.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine was pleased. &ldquo;Was it really like
that to you, my house?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! and more so than I know how to say.
Most of the windows and doors open, the glimpses of
tree branches and flowers and sky, the light and shade
in the rooms, all the flowers in vases in surprising
places, the colours of everything, the hangings&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stopped, embarrassed by her own enthusiasm,
or perhaps discomfited by Elsie&rsquo;s cool gaze. But
she had said more than enough to give Aunt Katherine
very real and deep pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I see,&rdquo; she told Kate, &ldquo;why you did not
mind wandering about alone or our seeming inhospitality.
And I think your dress, my dear, fitted
into the picture. It is a very poetic dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate flushed with pleasure. &ldquo;Mother would love
to hear you say that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We made it out
of the new chintz curtains in her bedroom. You
see I had to have some dresses, and there were the
curtains. Mother thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at mention of her mother Kate saw in morning
light what she had failed to see last night in lamplight:
the deepening of pain lines around Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s eyes and mouth, a cloud of pain somehow
in her face. So she broke off her account of Katherine&rsquo;s
ingenuity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it,&rdquo; she finished lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought you the key to the orchard
house,&rdquo; Aunt Katherine said, as though it were a
matter she would like to be done with quickly.
&ldquo;Elsie will show you all over it and around it. Then
I have an errand at the post office I wish you girls
would do for me. I have a very busy morning ahead.
The car is at your disposal this morning, and I should
think you would take a good long ride. It is really
too warm to do anything more energetic. At least,
it promises to be a very warm day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked at the key which Aunt Katherine had
handed her. It was an old-fashioned brass key,
clumsy and heavy but not too big to go into her
pocket. When she had tucked it away there she
raised defiant eyes to Elsie. But her defiance suddenly
turned to pity. Elsie looked so troubled!</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine with a word of apology to the girls
picked up the mail now lying at her place and began
reading the one or two personal letters she found
among the circulars, pleas for charity, and advertisements.
Kate leaned toward Elsie and said
quickly and softly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re safe to-day
and to-morrow, too, and for as long as you
mind, I guess. If I see the little house sometime,
what does it matter when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded to signify that she had caught the
very low words, and her face cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ungrateful thing! She might at least have
thanked me,&rdquo; Kate reflected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>But very soon she learned that Elsie was thanking
her for that impulsive gesture of generosity in her
own way. When they joined each other in the big
car that was waiting for them at the door, half an
hour later, Elsie was plainly trying to force herself
to be friendly and natural. But since this friendliness
was forced, Kate&rsquo;s response to it was of necessity
forced, too. Oh, how different everything
was turning out between these two girls from the
way Kate had dreamed it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Oakdale is pretty?&rdquo; Elsie asked.
&ldquo;People care so much about their gardens. And
then the streets are all so wide and shady, and where
they aren&rsquo;t wide they are just little lanes like ours
that end perhaps in a gate or an open meadow.
Those endings of streets seem romantic to me always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think they are romantic,&rdquo; Kate agreed.
&ldquo;And when your lane turned all the away around and
ended in the orchard, that must have been awfully
romantic. I wonder why Aunt Katherine ever let
the grass grow over it so that it got lost, the end of the
lane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in Elsie&rsquo;s restrained silence at this
remark made Kate realize that she had blundered.
Oh, dear! She hadn&rsquo;t meant to. Truly! She tried
to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see it was my mother&rsquo;s house, Elsie. You
can&rsquo;t know what fun it is to imagine your mother
a little girl, to see for the first time the house where
she was born and the places where she played.
Everything about your mother&rsquo;s childhood&mdash;well,
there&rsquo;s a kind of mystery about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie deliberately turned away her face. &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m sorry. What an idiot I am! I had forgotten
about your mother! How could I be such a&mdash;brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked at Timothy&rsquo;s back steadily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be so sorry as all that,&rdquo; she replied coolly and without
any apparent emotion in her voice. &ldquo;My mother
was killed in an automobile accident in France two
years ago. But I never knew her, anyway. When
I was at home she was usually somewhere else, at
house-parties or sanitariums, or abroad. And I
was only home for holidays. She sent me off to
boarding school when I was eight. Her being dead
hasn&rsquo;t made much difference to me. I was terribly
sorry for her when they told me, that was all. She
was so pretty, and too young-seeming to be a mother.
And she would have hated dying! Sometimes
I <i>ache</i> for her when I think of that. But that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can you! How can you speak about a
dead mother like that!&rdquo; Kate&rsquo;s heart was crying.
But she only said, after a second: &ldquo;There are lots
of jolly-looking girls and boys in this town. Do you
know them all? They keep looking at us, but you
never speak. Don&rsquo;t you <i>see</i> people? Mother&rsquo;s
like that. She&rsquo;s so absent minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even this was an unfortunate subject. Unlucky
Kate!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know who most of them are but of course I
don&rsquo;t know them socially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was amazing. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here all Elsie&rsquo;s attempt at friendliness broke
down. She turned on Kate a tigerish face. &ldquo;Yes,
why not?&rdquo; she almost hissed. &ldquo;You know very
well, Kate Marshall, why not. Here&rsquo;s the post
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was shocked. &ldquo;Well, I certainly <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know
&lsquo;why not&rsquo;,&rdquo; she contradicted. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least
idea&mdash;unless you treat them in the rude, horrid way
you treat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had drawn up to the curb and come to a
stand-still before the pride of Oakdale&rsquo;s civic life, its
white marble post office built on the lines of a Greek
temple. Elsie&rsquo;s only answer to Kate&rsquo;s denial was
a shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you letters? And are there any errands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy stood on the sidewalk asking for orders.</p>
<p>Elsie stood up quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll post the letters
myself,&rdquo; she answered him. Kate noticed for the
first time a package that Elsie was carrying. Across
the top the word &ldquo;Manuscript&rdquo; was written in a
round hand, and the address was that of a publishing
house and caught Kate&rsquo;s attention because it was
the same publishing house that had brought out
&ldquo;The King of the Fairies.&rdquo; Kate read the large
round black handwriting quite mechanically and
without any motive of curiosity as Elsie stepped
past her out of the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>When Elsie was halfway up the post-office steps
she turned and ran back to the curb. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t Aunt Katherine ask us to do something
for her? I&rsquo;ve quite forgotten what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A dollar book of stamps and ten special
deliveries. She gave you the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks. Good for your memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she sending to those publishers?&rdquo;
Kate found herself wondering when the spinning
glass doors had closed on her &ldquo;cousin.&rdquo; &ldquo;There
was a special delivery stamp on it, too. And it
filled her mind so full that she quite forgot Aunt&rsquo;s
errands. Can Elsie be trying to <i>write</i>? Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t
that be exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Holt and Holt&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Elsie ordered Timothy
when she returned to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holt and Holt&rsquo;s is a grocery store. I noticed it
as we came by,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear Aunt
Katherine say anything about groceries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Julia, the cook, attends to all that
over the telephone. This is my errand. Do you
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate refused to rise to the sarcasm in Elsie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do
you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at the grocers&rsquo; she said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll come, too,
and stretch my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; But Kate distinctly felt that Elsie
did not at all like the idea of having her companionship
in the store. However, her pride would not let
her turn back now, of course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s order was given briskly: &ldquo;A head of crisp
Iceland lettuce,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a small bottle of salad oil,
genuine Italian, half a pound of almonds, half a
dozen eggs, and the smallest loaf of bread you
have. Oh, yes, and a pound of flour, if you sell so
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the young clerk who had written
the order down in his book.</p>
<p>But Elsie waited. He looked at her inquiringly.
&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I want what I ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d send it, of course. It will be quite
a load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Please do the things up and put them into
my car for me. How much is it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re Miss Frazier, aren&rsquo;t
you? You folks have a charge account here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I want to pay for these things myself.
Do not by any means put them on Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
account.&rdquo; Elsie spoke primly but with flushed
cheeks that contradicted her outward composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d just tell you. Yesterday when you
came in and paid for things Mr. Holt said there must
be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no mistake. And will you please put
the box of eggs in a bag? Not just tie them with
a string like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up your way, miss, in about ten
minutes. Why don&rsquo;t we take &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>But Elsie shook her head, biting her lips with annoyance
at the young man&rsquo;s persistence. She commanded
him to put the things into the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Bookshop now,&rdquo; she ordered Timothy
as they started again.</p>
<p>At the Bookshop Kate did not speak of getting out,
though it certainly attracted her more than the
grocery store. But Elsie herself turned at the door.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to come, too, Kate?&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfully cunning little place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate and her mother were always drawn by bookshops
wherever they found them, and they spent in
them during the course of a year a sum that it would
have taken no budget expert to see was all out of
proportion to their income. But then, Katherine
always said when the subject of &ldquo;budgeting&rdquo; came
up that it was as foolish to make rules about the
spending of money as it would be to make rules about
the spending of time. It was a matter for the individual,
strictly. Kate followed Elsie eagerly,
now.</p>
<p>It was such a little shop that Kate, although she
immediately gravitated toward a table of books that
interested her particularly, could not avoid hearing
Elsie&rsquo;s conversation with the Bookshop woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you Havelock Ellis&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dance of Life&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a new order has just come in. I knew
Miss Frazier wanted it and I was sending it up first
thing this afternoon. Would you like to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take one for my aunt, if she ordered it.
I&rsquo;ll take two. One is for myself, and I will pay for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt always charges. Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I charge them
both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will pay for it. How much is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four dollars! Oh, dear! So much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was very obliging. &ldquo;Why not charge
it?&rdquo; she suggested again, for Elsie was looking woefully
into her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Let me think a minute. Well, I won&rsquo;t buy
it to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s face had so fallen, she was so obviously disappointed,
that Kate went over to her. &ldquo;I have
money,&rdquo; she offered. &ldquo;Five dollars. You can borrow
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she spoke her glance quite unconsciously
fell upon the purse opened in Elsie&rsquo;s hand. A little
roll of crisp bills lay there for any one to see, amounting
surely to more than four dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo; Elsie replied, snapping the purse
shut. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Kate turned it over quickly as they went back
to the car. Why had Elsie acted, as she certainly
had acted, as though she did not have four dollars
in her purse when it was perfectly plain that she
had more? And why did she want the book, anyway?
Katherine had bought that book less than a
week ago, and Kate had had an opportunity to look
into it to find what of interest there might be for
herself. She had found nothing. It was decidedly
a book for adults, a rather deep book, and, to Kate&rsquo;s
mind, a dull book. But perhaps Elsie only wanted
it to give away. Anyway, she would ask no questions.
It was none of her business.</p>
<p>Timothy showed distinct surprise at Elsie&rsquo;s nonchalant
&ldquo;Home, Timothy.&rdquo; And Kate understood
his surprise. Aunt Katherine had given them the
car for the morning and Timothy was all prepared
to start off on a long drive. But Elsie had apparently
forgotten about this in her worry over the
book. And Kate had no impulse to remind her.
If things were only as one might expect them to be,
not all so strangely mysterious and unpleasant, a car
at her disposal and a comrade on a beautiful summer
morning like this would have seemed the height
of pleasure. But such a ride with Elsie would certainly
be no fun, and she did not think until it was
too late that she alone with Timothy might start
off on an exploring adventure.</p>
<p>When they got out of the car in front of their
own door, Timothy, as a matter of course, expected
to take the packages from the grocery store around
to the servants&rsquo; entrance. But Elsie held out her
hands for them. He relinquished them to her,
plainly puzzled. Surely they were groceries!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>When the two girls stood together in the big front
hall Kate said briefly: &ldquo;Good-bye. I&rsquo;m going out
into the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait on the terrace outside the drawing-room
and I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; Elsie responded, very unexpectedly.
&ldquo;First I&rsquo;ll just run up to my room with
these bundles. I know a lot about the kinds of
flowers and things in the garden. Let me show it
all to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was almost dazed by this suggestion. She
had certainly been made to feel that Elsie was only
too eager to get rid of her company. She stood
where she had been left, wondering.</p>
<p>Why had Elsie taken lettuce and oil and bread and
eggs and flour and nuts up to her room? What
could she ever do with them up there?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not ask her about it,&rdquo; she promised herself,
&ldquo;just not a thing. But I shall write to Mother and
the boys this morning. I won&rsquo;t tell Mother how
horrid Elsie is being, though. She would be too
disappointed for me. And I&rsquo;m really not having
such a bad time as it might sound. But I&rsquo;ll tell the
boys just everything. They will be as mystified as
I am. And to think I was dissatisfied with them
for chums and wanted a <i>girl</i>! I&rsquo;ll appreciate them
when I get back, that&rsquo;s certain. Oh, of course!
Why didn&rsquo;t I think at first! Elsie doesn&rsquo;t trust me
in the garden alone! That&rsquo;s why she wants to come
with me. She is afraid I won&rsquo;t keep my promise.
She&rsquo;s afraid I will go &lsquo;prowling&rsquo; around the orchard
house. I just wish I hadn&rsquo;t promised not to use the
key. It would be something to do with this morning
she&rsquo;s spoiled. And something to write Mother
about. And it might explain some of the mystery.
There <i>was</i> a light last night. I saw it plain enough.
The boys will be interested in all that. How soon
can I expect letters from home, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these thoughts Kate went out through the
cool, shady drawing-room and on to the terrace.
There in the shade of some trellised wisteria she sat
down on a garden bench to wait for Elsie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;EVEN SO&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Elsie was a very long time in coming. As the
minutes dragged themselves along Kate&rsquo;s cheeks
began to get hot even before she realized that she
was angry. But after she had waited so long
that she was convinced Elsie was not coming at
all she got up with a shrug. Any one who knew
Kate would have seen at once that she was in no
ordinary mood; for shrugs or any such Latin methods
of self-expression were quite foreign to this girl,
New England bred.</p>
<p>She went up to her room for paper. Now was the
time to write to her mother and Sam and Lee. Certainly
she had enough to tell them!</p>
<p>The door to the sitting-room across the hall was
standing open and a glance assured Kate that it
was empty. And while she did not actually look into
Elsie&rsquo;s room she heard no sound and felt that Elsie
was not there. But she had no idea where Bertha had
put the writing paper when she unpacked the suitcase
and the envelopes and stamps. She searched
through the drawers of the dressing table. But
there were only her ribbons, her handkerchiefs, her
underclothes arranged artistically. No sign of paper
or fountain pen. So, although she had meant
never to go into the sitting-room, she was forced to
now. Her writing materials must be in the desk
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>She found them at once. And now being in the
room, she took the occasion to look all about. It
was the jolliest place imaginable for a girl to call
her own! And since the morning had grown rather
oppressively hot it was a refuge, too; for there was a
breeze on this side of the house and it was the coolest
spot Kate had found herself in that morning. Tree
shadows stood on the walls, and leaf shadows shook
in a green, cool light. It would be very nice to sit
here and write. But Kate could not bring herself to
do it. She reminded herself that this was Elsie&rsquo;s
desk and room, and therefore hateful.</p>
<p>Picking up her own property she hurried out and
down the stairs. Once in the garden she made
directly for the apple orchard. She would allow
herself to walk along the edge viewing the orchard
house from that angle. If Elsie called that prowling,
let her! As she walked she felt the brass key in her
pocket. But though now her whole mind was on the
house and her desire to go into it, it never entered
her head to break her promise. Elsie certainly deserved
her anger, but revengeful thinking was quite
outside of Kate&rsquo;s mentality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>When she had walked the whole length of the
orchard she came to a low, broad hedge that marked
the termination of Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s grounds. Near
it she sat down, not in the orchard but in its shade,
and placing her block of paper on her knee began
to write.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Mother&rdquo;:&mdash;And then so suddenly that
it startled her, tears blotted the two words. At the
same minute she heard running feet. Kate winked
fast and furiously and looked up. Elsie was standing
over her. She was flushed from running in the heat
and her eyes were very bright and soft. Again she
was radiating happiness as on Kate&rsquo;s first glimpse
of her. On her arm swung a straw basket and one
hand held a pair of shining shears. Kate felt that
she would rather die on the spot than let Elsie guess
that she was crying. But if Elsie saw the tears she
showed no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t get here sooner, and that I
asked you to wait.&rdquo; She spoke in a conciliatory tone.
&ldquo;Truly I&rsquo;m not so rude as I seemed. But I had an
unexpected opportunity to attend to something that
needed attention and there wasn&rsquo;t time to run down
and tell you. It had to be done quickly. But now
I&rsquo;m ready. I thought as we walked around I&rsquo;d cut
some flowers for our rooms. Aunt Katherine likes
me to keep my vases filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it was Kate who was cold and distant.
Her shame in her tears made that necessary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
writing to my mother,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And I
don&rsquo;t need to be entertained a bit. Some other
time I&rsquo;ll help you with the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s glow flickered and went out. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
she said, and turned away sharply to cut some
nasturtiums growing around the foot of an apple
tree.</p>
<p>But just as she turned there came a shout from
over the hedge. A boy older than themselves, in
fact a young man of seventeen probably, had come
to the tennis court, only a few paces beyond the
hedge, with a racket and balls in his hand. He was
calling to a girl on the steps of the piazza of the
house next door. &ldquo;Hurry up,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just a minute.&rdquo; The girl was bending over
on the steps, tying her shoe perhaps. In a minute
she had come bounding down the long slope of the
lawn and joined her brother.</p>
<p>Kate looked at them interestedly. &ldquo;Who are
they?&rdquo; she asked of Elsie. Elsie gave her the information
without turning. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Rose Denton
and her brother Jack. And they&rsquo;d ask you to
play, probably, if they saw you, and I weren&rsquo;t here.
They just barely speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barely speak to you? And they live right next
door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, queer, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; The voice above the nasturtiums
was sarcastic. &ldquo;Only get yourself noticed
and you&rsquo;ll soon know them. Hope you have a
good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Elsie straightened up, adjusted her basket on her
arm, and moved away. But Kate called after her, her
voice shaking with anger, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you
are so queer, Elsie Frazier, or why you haven&rsquo;t
friends. But while I&rsquo;m visiting you it isn&rsquo;t likely
I&rsquo;d play with people who won&rsquo;t play with you, no
matter how much they asked me. That&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie turned and walked backward now. &ldquo;Well,
Kate Marshall, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have just a horrid
month then,&rdquo; she prophesied. And with a strange,
almost strangled little laugh she whirled about and
was really off with her basket and shears.</p>
<p>Kate watched her as she went, floating toward the
gardens across the smooth lawn. &ldquo;She walks like a
dryad,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and she looks like a Dorothy
Lathrop fairy.&rdquo; Then she smiled a little woefully
at her own fancy. &ldquo;She may look like a fairy but
she&rsquo;s a horrid, stuck-up thing just the same,&rdquo; she
reminded herself.</p>
<p>But she found relief for her overcharged emotions
when she came to the compositions of her letter to
the Hart boys. There she described Elsie just as she
was and had behaved. Not one unpleasant thing
that Elsie had done was forgotten. Perhaps it was
rather horrid of Kate to complain so unrestrainedly
and set down so much criticism. But she did not
give that a thought&mdash;not then. When the letter
was finished and in its envelope she pulled it out
again to add a postscript.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<blockquote>
<p>P. S. It&rsquo;s all true what I have told you about Elsie Frazier,
every bit. But <i>even so</i>, I don&rsquo;t hate her and now that I&rsquo;ve written
about her I&rsquo;m not even angry any more. She&rsquo;s hardly said
a friendly word or acted a bit as you would expect her to to a
guest, but even so if she only were nice to me I&rsquo;d be quite crazy
about her. That isn&rsquo;t just because she&rsquo;s so pretty, either. I
don&rsquo;t know why I feel that way, but I do. She&rsquo;s exactly the
sort of chum I&rsquo;ve always imagined having some day. And
there&rsquo;s one thing good I can tell you about her. She likes
&ldquo;The King of the Fairies,&rdquo; I think. Anyway, she owns it. So
what do you make of it all? And what about the light in the
orchard house? And why do you suppose Elsie is so set against
my using the key? And why did she buy those groceries and
take them up to her room? Don&rsquo;t tell Mother a word I&rsquo;ve told
you about how mean Elsie is. <i>She</i> must think I&rsquo;m having a
<i>lovely</i> time&mdash;at least, until I know whether I can stick it out or
not. K.M.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KATE MEETS A DETECTIVE</span></h2>
<p>When Kate came to luncheon that day she was
surprised to see a letter lying at her place.
So soon? Why, she had not been here a day yet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your mother&rsquo;s handwriting,&rdquo; Aunt
Katherine said, a little curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s from the boys. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told you about them last night, you know.
The twins. The Harts. How jolly of them to
write me so soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can they have to tell you since yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all about Mother, and much better than
a letter from her herself because she doesn&rsquo;t know
how to tell about herself, you know. She&rsquo;s always so
silent on that subject. Do you mind, Aunt, if I
just open it and peek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear, read it. Elsie and I will
excuse you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>But there was almost no letter inside. There was
one paragraph in the exact centre of a big square
sheet of yellow notepaper, written in a script so small
and round and legible that it was almost print like.
But the very wide margins were bordered with a
series of pen sketches that told a story in its progressive
action something in the way a moving picture
does. It was the story of a picnic the Harts had
arranged for yesterday afternoon with Katherine
the guest of honour. Professor Hart, in an endeavour
to rescue the lunch basket which had fallen into
a brook, had evidently fallen in after it. That
perhaps was the high mark in the artist&rsquo;s work. But
the picnic had been chock full of adventure one could
see at a glance; and Lee&rsquo;s quick humour and real art
had turned even the worst mishaps into fun.</p>
<p>The paragraph was in Sam&rsquo;s hand, and began:
&ldquo;Dear Kate, if you are well it is well. We also
are well.&rdquo; Apparently he had nothing whatsoever
to say, but he said it cheerfully.</p>
<p>Kate crinkled up her eyes and laughed so wholeheartedly
over the nonsense that she felt herself
rude. She passed the paper to Aunt Katherine.
&ldquo;You will see that I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>And Aunt Katherine, after she had studied the
pictures a few seconds and skimmed the paragraph,
laughed, too, a light, genuinely amused laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not only funny, though,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s artistic.
Which boy drew these pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lee. He&rsquo;s always sketching. He means to be
a real artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is that already. All he needs now is
study. I would say he has a future if he has the will
to stick to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine now handed the letter to Elsie
and turned back to Kate to remark: &ldquo;Your mother,
on accepting my invitation for you, mentioned the
fact that you were lonely, in need of friends as much
as Elsie. But I don&rsquo;t see how any one could be
more companionable or amusing than these boys,
from your descriptions and this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate glowed at Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s appreciation of
Sam and Lee. &ldquo;Oh, Mother meant <i>girl</i> friends.
There just doesn&rsquo;t happen to be any one near my age
in Ashland. And while boys are all right, they
aren&rsquo;t exactly the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie had lost some of her indifference and coldness
over the letter. She was almost smiling, in fact.
Now she was actually smiling. Kate beamed.
This was certainly the most natural minute and the
happiest since her arrival. She blessed the Hart
boys for having created it.</p>
<p>But Aunt Katherine was surprised when it developed
that the girls had not been exploring the
countryside in the car that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you use Timothy at all?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for errands in the town. Kate wrote letters
and I picked and arranged flowers, and read &lsquo;The
King of the Fairies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think, Elsie, you possessed only one
book. When are you going to finish with &lsquo;The
King of the Fairies&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Elsie&rsquo;s tone had fallen
suddenly into sulkiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But though Aunt Katherine did not seem to notice
the sudden chilling of the atmosphere, Kate did and
spoke quickly, a trifle nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read &lsquo;The King of the Fairies,&rsquo;
Aunt Katherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. It&rsquo;s a fairy story, a child&rsquo;s book. It
surprises me that Elsie, a big girl of fifteen, finds it
so fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother finds it fascinating, too,&rdquo; Kate hurried
to assure her. &ldquo;And I know it just about by heart.
Mother keeps saying it&rsquo;s the most beautiful love
story she ever read. And even the boys like it.
They felt just the way you do about its title. But
once they got into it they couldn&rsquo;t stop. If you
read it yourself you&rsquo;d see why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was fairly radiant with her enthusiasm about
this book. Her aunt smiled into her eager eyes. &ldquo;I
shall certainly look it over, then,&rdquo; she promised.
&ldquo;It must be an unusual book to inspire such loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring my copy down and put it on your
reading table right after luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a copy with you! It <i>must</i> be a favourite!
Thank you, Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elsie did not offer a word to this topic. She
sat, colder than ever, looking at the wall to the
right of Kate&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;As Timothy hasn&rsquo;t been working this morning,
I think I shall have him take me in to Boston this
afternoon,&rdquo; Aunt Katherine said, as she helped the
girls to lemon ice which had just been set before her
in a frosted bowl. &ldquo;Driving is about the coolest
thing one can do to-day. Will either or both of you
come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. <i>I</i> should love to.&rdquo; Kate was secretly
relieved that with this promise she would not be
thrown alone with Elsie again that afternoon. And
she was even more relieved when Elsie said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe I&rsquo;ll go, thank you, Aunt Katherine. I shall
read or do something here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Kate was on her way up to get her hat for the
drive she was stopped at the stair-turning by a
woman who had come through a door connecting
with a different staircase. She was a middle-aged,
plump person with graying curly hair, in a starched
black and white print dress, almost entirely concealed
by a crisp white apron. It was the cook,
Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Kate,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly,
and almost in a whisper. &ldquo;Excuse me, but I just
had to ask how is your blessed mother? Miss
Frazier never tells us anything at all. She ain&rsquo;t sick
or anything, is she, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate reassured her. &ldquo;But did you know Mother?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. We all did, &rsquo;cept Isadora. She&rsquo;s new
since. Your mother was for ever in and out of the
house and we all loved her. Didn&rsquo;t she ever tell
you the time she broke her arm falling on the kitchen
stairs? And she never cried, if you&rsquo;ll believe me.
Only moaned just a bit, even when the doctor come
and fixed it. Miss Frazier was away and old Mr.
Frazier, too. So I had to manage. Didn&rsquo;t she ever
tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had to admit that she had never heard the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she wan&rsquo;t one to talk about herself, she
wan&rsquo;t. Always interested in <i>you</i> and sort of forgot
herself like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate nodded at that. Evidently Julia did know
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say she&rsquo;s perfectly well? We&rsquo;ll all be
grateful for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s voice came up to them from the
hall at this point. She was talking to Elsie. As
quickly as she had appeared, Julia whisked about and
was out of the door through which she had come.
But quick as a wink, and almost as if by magic,
before she vanished she had produced from somewhere
a gingerbread man and pushed it into Kate&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Kate looked at the gift, amused, when Julia was
gone. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have realized how old I am,&rdquo;
she thought, smiling. &ldquo;She thinks I&rsquo;m just Mother&rsquo;s
&lsquo;child.&rsquo;&rdquo; Up in her room she hid it under her
pillow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was pleasant speeding along with her aunt
toward Boston, creating their own breeze as they
went through the hot July afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, Kate,&rdquo; Aunt Katherine questioned
her abruptly as soon as they were on their way.
&ldquo;Are you and Elsie getting on well? Are you becoming
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was difficult for Kate. She hesitated. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think Elsie likes me,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;She
tries to be&mdash;polite, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like you? Nonsense! How could she help
liking you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate laughed. &ldquo;I suppose you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> like everybody,&rdquo;
she said modestly. &ldquo;But Elsie doesn&rsquo;t seem
to like very many people. That boy and girl next
door&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t play with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rose and Jack Denton. You know the
reason for the coldness there, of course. But you
are quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know the reason. Why hasn&rsquo;t she
friends here? I don&rsquo;t know anything. She hasn&rsquo;t
explained at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine showed real surprise. &ldquo;Do you
mean your mother hasn&rsquo;t told you why things are
difficult for Elsie? Is she as ashamed as that?
Well, she feels even more strongly than I had suspected
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitterness and sorrow had settled on Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s
features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mother knew anything to tell me,&rdquo;
Kate protested. &ldquo;Why are things difficult for
Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;If your mother hasn&rsquo;t told you, she wouldn&rsquo;t
want <i>me</i> to. That is certain. But I am surprised
she let you come, feeling so. However, since she
did let you come, and you have no prejudice, Elsie
has no business to include you in her rages. You
are the one person in the world she should be friendly
with and grateful to. And, you know, I am sure
she exaggerates other people&rsquo;s attitude, anyway.
The young people would be friendly enough if she
would only go halfway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine put her hand on Kate&rsquo;s arm and
continued earnestly: &ldquo;That is one reason why I
wanted you to come so much, to help us break the
ice. Friday I am giving a party in your honour,
Kate, an informal little dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate clasped her hands. For a minute she forgot
all the mystery that had gone before in her aunt&rsquo;s
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dance! Oh, Aunt Katherine, how beautiful
of you!&rdquo; To herself she added, &ldquo;Glory, glory!
Already things are beginning to happen just as
Mother said they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked fifteen boys and thirteen girls.
<i>They have all, every one, accepted!</i> If that doesn&rsquo;t
prove how mistaken Elsie is, I am a very foolish
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie hasn&rsquo;t mentioned the party to me,&rdquo; Kate
wondered aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t told her anything about it yet.
I wanted you here and established first. I hoped
that once you and she were having a happy, gay time
together, she would soften, feel more in the mood.
Most of the young people I have asked she had met
when visiting me during school vacations. She was
very popular with them before&mdash;well, before. But
there are a few new families who have come to
Oakdale since&mdash;well, since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before what? Since what?&rdquo; If it was rude of
Kate, she could not help it. It was all too mystifying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what I can&rsquo;t tell you, since Katherine
hasn&rsquo;t. Only, your not knowing makes it a
bit complicated. No, I&rsquo;m not sure of that. It
may make everything more simple, more natural.
But tell me, can&rsquo;t you be friends with Elsie? She
needs your friendship and companionship more than
you can guess, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Perhaps we shall be friends yet. But
she does act awfully <i>queer</i>. Oh, it&rsquo;s mean of me to
talk about her so. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve done something.
Perhaps there&rsquo;s a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a strange child. Strange! But she
used to be different. I always thought she seemed
a little lost and lonely, you know. That was mostly
because of her mother&mdash;no mother at all, in reality.
Just a butterfly. In spite of that Elsie was agreeable
and tender once. Quite a dear. But since she has
come to live with me she has been entirely a changed
person. You must believe, though, Kate, that there
is no more reason for her to be unfriendly toward
you than there is for her to be unfriendly toward
me. And I am speaking truly when I say there has
hardly been a friendly moment between us since
she came into my home. She is polite, beautifully
polite. I suppose that absurd fashionable boarding
school she was sent to taught her manners. But it
goes no deeper. How do <i>you</i> feel about it? Is there
anything unkind or wrong in the way I treat Elsie?
Have you noticed anything in the brief time you
have been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was amazed to have Aunt Katherine so
appealing to her. All barriers were down between
them. They were talking as two girls might, or
two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing unkind, of course! I don&rsquo;t know how
you could be kinder. But, Aunt Katherine, do you
truly like Elsie? It may be that she <i>feels</i>, in spite
of your kindness, that you just don&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it seem that way to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;perhaps not. But there is something in
your voice when you speak to her&mdash;a difference.
I don&rsquo;t know how to express it. If you truly don&rsquo;t
like her, perhaps you can&rsquo;t help showing it a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine said no more for a while. But
she was thinking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; she said finally,
&ldquo;very queer, the way I am talking to you. I am
treating you as though you were your mother almost.
And you are like your mother, in deep ways. Only
you are franker, more open. You say right out the
things that she might think but wouldn&rsquo;t say.
Well, and since I am saying things right out, too&mdash;I
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> like Elsie. You are right there. I tried to.
But I simply couldn&rsquo;t. She is too unnatural, too
cold and heartless, and perhaps self-seeking. The
irony of it is that she is all I have left to love, the only
person in the world who needs me now&mdash;or, rather,
the only person who will let herself use me. But I
can&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was embarrassed at this revelation, and at
the same time deeply sorry for her aunt. For the
present the subject dropped between them.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In Boston Kate looked about her with the greatest
interest as the car crept through the crowded business
section. She had been in Boston before on brief
holiday visits with her mother, stopping at little
boarding houses, and spending most of the time in
art galleries or the Museum or on trolley rides to
places of historical interest. But now she was seeing
it from a new angle, leisurely and in comfort. There
was no jostling, no hurrying, no aching feet.</p>
<p>They drew up to a curb in Boylston Street. Timothy
got out and came around for orders. &ldquo;Go up
and ask Mr. O&rsquo;Brien to come down to the car,
Timothy. Tell him I have only a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at once a spruce, energetic-looking young
man stood at the car door, his straw hat in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have our interview, no
matter how brief, in my office, Miss Frazier?&rdquo; he
suggested deferentially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Miss Frazier shook her head with decision. &ldquo;No.
I just want to ask you one question. Is there any
news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien glanced toward Kate significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my niece,&rdquo; Miss Frazier informed him
but not at all in the way of an introduction. &ldquo;Tell
me, have you the slightest news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that is very certain. We have a new
clue, perhaps. But I cannot go into that before
your niece, Miss Frazier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is not Elsie. It&rsquo;s another niece, a blood
relation. And I do not intend to climb those stairs
to your office. You can surely give me some hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an elevator. You forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter. I am not going up. Be quick,
please. Naturally, I am impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was certainly catching a glimpse now of the
bossy Aunt Katherine of tradition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we just have an idea. We should like to
know whether your other niece, Miss Elsie, ever comes
into Boston alone. Has she been in this week, say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. Certainly not. Bertha, her maid, is
with her when I am not. She is a chaperon as well
as a maid. I trust her. She happens to be a very
remarkable woman for a servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Elsie does come in, then, without you
sometimes? Is she planning to come soon again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. But what this has to do with the
business I can&rsquo;t see. I&rsquo;m sending her in to-morrow
with her maid and Miss Kate to buy party frocks
and see &lsquo;The Blue Bird.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; Mr. O&rsquo;Brien seemed much pleased.
&ldquo;Will they go directly to the store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pearl&rsquo;s. A modiste on Beacon Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. May I have one word in your ear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason.&rdquo; But Miss Frazier leaned a
little toward the insistent young man while he
lowered his voice so that Kate did not catch one
word of what he said.</p>
<p>Her aunt laughed, amused apparently. &ldquo;Much
good that will do you. I have told you, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien,
there is not a chance in the world that Miss Elsie
knows any more than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, you do not object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Except that it is a foolish waste of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not lose time through it, I assure you.
Other members of my staff are working on other
clues. Precious few there are, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is all I will say &lsquo;good afternoon,&rsquo; then.&rdquo;
Miss Frazier settled back in her seat. &ldquo;You will
call me up, of course, the minute there is anything
definite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But does Miss Elsie often answer the
telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. Very seldom. I tell you, Mr.
O&rsquo;Brien, there is no rhyme or reason to your suspicions
in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, Miss Frazier, I beg you to adjure Miss
Kate here to secrecy. She should, on no condition,
tell Miss Elsie one word she has heard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Miss Frazier nodded, glancing at Kate. Kate&rsquo;s
return look carried her promise. &ldquo;I shall hope for
something more definite when next I hear from you,
Mr. O&rsquo;Brien. Good afternoon. Home, Timothy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stood on the curb while the big car
pulled out. There was a troubled, displeased expression
on his face, Kate thought. She knew that
he resented very much the interview not having
been more private.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a detective?&rdquo; she asked her aunt curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a private detective, and a very good one.
But perhaps he is right, Kate, and you had better
forget all about him. If he is doing the job I suppose
he has a right to do it in his own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A private detective! And what had a detective
to suspect of Elsie! But Kate took her aunt&rsquo;s hint
and asked no more questions.</p>
<p>Their way home took them by the Green Shutter
Tea Room, a quaint little place built by a stream in
a grove of maples. The tables were set out under
the trees. Aunt Katherine suggested that they
stop. And when they were seated opposite each
other at a little round green table, their order given,
they smiled at each other contentedly, like friends
of long standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SOMETHING OF FAIRY IN IT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me a word about how you like
the orchard house!&rdquo; Aunt Katherine said.
&ldquo;Did you go all over it? The study is really the
nicest room. Did you like that? And did you see
your mother&rsquo;s old playroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate hesitated to confess to her aunt that she had
not been near the orchard house. It might involve
Elsie too much. She remembered Elsie&rsquo;s plea last
night. So she hesitated, feeling her cheeks redden.
But after an instant she said, &ldquo;I think I shall save
it for a day when there isn&rsquo;t so much to do. It&rsquo;s a
darling house, but I haven&rsquo;t been in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the party on Thursday I am hoping that
all your days here will be full of things to do, yours
and Elsie&rsquo;s, too. She will begin to have the life of
other girls again. For myself I have hardly cared a
bit. I had rather grown away from my old friends,
anyway, and larger interests, or at least more impersonal
interests, have been absorbing me of late
years. But now I&rsquo;m pocketing my pride for Elsie&rsquo;s
sake, and going more than halfway toward reconciliations....
Madame Pearl, the woman to
whom I am sending you to-morrow for frocks, is an
artist in her way. You two girls must choose dresses
that not only become yourselves but go well together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>For Kate all the puzzling hints that ran through her
aunt&rsquo;s conversation were forgotten in this new subject.
&ldquo;But Mother and I thought my pink organdie
would do for a party, if you gave one. You
haven&rsquo;t seen it. I shall wear it for dinner to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen it, but I am sure it is very
dainty and pretty. Even so, this is to be Elsie&rsquo;s first
real party, and her first real party frock. And it
will be more appropriate for you to have dresses
that match in a way, or contrast with each other
artistically. You <i>will</i> let me give you such a gift,
won&rsquo;t you, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was surprising entreaty in Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s
dark eyes, and fear, too. Would Kate be simply an
echo of her mother? Would she rise up in pride and
say, &ldquo;No charity, thanks&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kate was thinking rapidly. She had
no idea whatever whether her mother would want
her to accept a party frock from Aunt Katherine or
not. But quickly she decided that her mother would
want her to speak for herself now, that this was a
matter between herself and her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall love to have a party dress,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, but you are good to me, Aunt
Katherine! And it will be my first as well as
Elsie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Miss Frazier flushed, pleasure all out of proportion
to the event, seemingly, shining from her eyes.
She said &ldquo;Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; in as heartfelt accents
as though Kate herself were the donor.</p>
<p>Kate laughed at that, her eyes crinkling, and
after the laugh her mouth still stayed tilted up at
the corners. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so excited,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you going to Boston with us, to Madame
Pearl&rsquo;s, to help us choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. Bertha has excellent taste, and
Madame Pearl herself would not make a mistake. And
I think that the more I am out of it the better the
chance is that you and Elsie will find each other.
A day together, shopping, lunching at my club, and
seeing &lsquo;The Blue Bird&rsquo; afterward ought to give two
girls all the opportunity they need to get over any
strangeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Blue Bird&rsquo;! Well, it&rsquo;s just as Mother said
it would be, wonderful things galore! Oh, dear!
I wish she could know this minute that I&rsquo;m to see
&lsquo;The Blue Bird&rsquo;! We&rsquo;ve read it, of course. But to
see it! I shall write her again to-night&mdash;and the
boys, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was sitting with clasped hands, her hazel
eyes narrowed and golden with light. She was almost
little-girlish in her excitement and pleasure, and
of course the corners of her mouth were uptilted at
their most winged angle. Aunt Katherine, watching
her, thought, &ldquo;She is better than pretty, this grand-niece
of mine. She is fascinating. Just to look at
her stirs your imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>But she said, &ldquo;Eat your toast before it is cold, I advise
you. And don&rsquo;t neglect the marmalade. It
is unusually good marmalade they serve here at the
Green Shutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Kate came to earth. &ldquo;But such a nice
earth!&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p>Before they had finished their tea, Aunt Katherine
rose to a pitch of confidences that surprised herself.
But it was just exactly as though in Kate she had
found a friend, a friend to whom she was able to open
her heart. At this moment in her life Miss Frazier
needed this sort of a confidante badly. They were
talking about Elsie again and her coldness and indifference
to Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one obvious explanation for it,&rdquo; Aunt
Katherine said. &ldquo;I can think of no other. She
may be jealous. She may have been jealous from the
first minute of your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was too surprised to think at all. &ldquo;Jealous&mdash;<i>of
me</i>? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you might take her place with me, cheat
her somehow of what she apparently considers hers.
She sees, as you have guessed, that I do not like her.
May she not be all the more jealous of you just because
of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no.&rdquo; Kate was thinking clearly again.
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t horrid like that. I know it. She&rsquo;s too
beautiful and lovely. There&rsquo;s something about her
that makes any such idea just impossible. She
mayn&rsquo;t like me, and I may be cross with her, but for
all that&mdash;for all that I know she&rsquo;s not a <i>mean</i> person,
Aunt Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was amazed herself at having so suddenly become
Elsie&rsquo;s champion. Loyalty to that strange girl
had apparently been born in her all in a second. Or
was it loyalty only to the comrade she had glimpsed
flashingly, once in the mirror last night, and once in
sunshine this morning? Whatever it was to, it was
very real and staunch.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s face lightened remarkably.
&ldquo;You may be right, and I earnestly hope you are,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;For if Elsie were unfriendly toward you
for any such reason&mdash;well, it would be the last straw,
the very last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they spun along toward home through the cooling
air, Miss Frazier&rsquo;s expression grew happier and
happier. Kate had done for her what she could not
do for herself: lightened real suspicions, and eased her
heart.</p>
<p>It was almost dinner time when they arrived. If
Kate was to don her pink organdie she would have to
hurry. She raced up the stairs and found Bertha in
her room waiting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have only ten minutes, Miss Kate,&rdquo; she
warned. &ldquo;Your bath is set.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>A glance showed Kate the pink organdie freshly
pressed, crisp and cool, hung over a chair back, and
the white slip to go under it on the bed. Her pumps
were set down by the dressing table and some fresh
stockings near on a stool. Two baths a day! How
comfortable! Kate, still aglow with her afternoon,
had quite forgotten her self-consciousness with this
lady&rsquo;s maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Elsie dressed?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Bertha answered rather worriedly: &ldquo;No, and
none of us have seen her all afternoon. I do wish
she would come up. I can&rsquo;t think how she&rsquo;s been
amusing herself, or where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate herself began to wonder, when she had had
her bath and was freshly dressed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
gong!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>But simultaneously with the note of the gong
Elsie&rsquo;s door slammed and there she was in the bathroom
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; she called, but not at all ruefully.
&ldquo;No time to dress, Bertha. Hello, Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wash your face, whether there&rsquo;s
time or not,&rdquo; Bertha assured her. &ldquo;And your hair,
it&rsquo;s a sight! Where did you get like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie laughed, elfin laughter. &ldquo;Never mind where.
And you aren&rsquo;t my nurse. You&rsquo;re my tiring-woman.
Bear that in mind, Mrs. Bertha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha&rsquo;s worried face changed into a beaming one.
Elsie in such good spirits! That was the best that
Bertha asked of life, Kate intuitively felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>But it was true enough. Elsie very much needed
washing and brushing. Her nose and forehead were
beaded with little drops of perspiration, her cheeks
were a burning red, as though she had been sitting
over a fire, or perhaps long in the sun, and there were
smudges of what looked like flour on chin and arms.
As for her hair, it was all in little damp curls across
her brow and over her ears: one side had come completely
undone, and showered down on to her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me see how you ever got
in such a mess,&rdquo; Bertha murmured happily as she
officiated in Elsie&rsquo;s hurried cleaning up. &ldquo;You might
just as well be a cook in a kitchen! But, oh, dear!
What&rsquo;s that burn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is horrid, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Elsie agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you need a nurse more than a lady&rsquo;s
maid! Did Julia let you get near the stove on this
broiling day? Here&rsquo;s some olive oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another minute of scurrying Elsie appeared
in Kate&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;It was nice of you to wait for me,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve made you late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine lifted her brows when she saw
Elsie still in her blue and white morning dress. But
the fact that the girls had come in together, actually
arm-in-arm, made up for much. In fact, it put Aunt
Katherine into a light and gay mood. Things were
beginning to go as she had planned now. At dinner
she told Elsie about the party set for Friday night.
And Elsie, who herself was in a gay spirit, thanked
her aunt prettily for everything&mdash;the coming party,
the promised frock, and the seats for &ldquo;The Blue
Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she is a human being, after all,&rdquo; Kate admitted.
&ldquo;This morning and last night seems like
some dream I had about her.&rdquo; And Kate opened her
hazel eyes a little wider now as she looked at Elsie
across the table. She was on the watch for the
reappearance of the vanishing comrade.</p>
<p>That evening again Miss Frazier sent the girls to
walk in the garden. She herself settled down in the
big winged chair under her especial reading lamp and
picked up &ldquo;The King of the Fairies,&rdquo; which Kate
had not forgotten to place there.</p>
<p>The orchard drew all Kate&rsquo;s attention once they
were out in the growing starlight. She looked toward
it often as they paced back and forth on the
garden paths. At first she talked to Elsie about her
afternoon, the ride, and the Green Shutter Tea
Room. But Elsie, though she listened with interest,
and even took pains to ask questions, in return gave
Kate no information as to how <i>she</i> had spent the
hours. Even so, Elsie was so completely changed
that finally Kate had the hardihood to tell her laughingly
about the light she had seen in the orchard
house last night before falling to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I saw the light. But of course I
couldn&rsquo;t have heard the door,&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;That
must have been imagination, for sound doesn&rsquo;t carry
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this mention of the orchard house Elsie&rsquo;s
new manner fell from her as though she had dropped
a cloak. She stiffened as they walked and her voice
took on restraint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you imagined the sound of the door, why wasn&rsquo;t
the light imagination, too?&rdquo; she asked reasonably.
&ldquo;Or it may have been fireflies in the trees. See them
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true enough. Over in the orchard fireflies
were twinkling, almost in clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like firefly light, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were almost asleep, weren&rsquo;t you? It
was probably fireflies and sleepiness all mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did not acknowledge that she was impressed
by this reasoning. But deep in her mind she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not to tell Aunt Katherine about the
light. Promise me that. She would go investigating
then. You&rsquo;ve got to promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s quick temper flashed up and ruined the new
relation between them at Elsie&rsquo;s brusque command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got to promise. Why do you think
you can boss me like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s answer to that was a tossed head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going in,&rdquo; she said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> not.&rdquo; Kate sat down abruptly in a garden
chair they were passing. When Elsie had gone on
Kate bit her lip, hard, hard to keep back the tears.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve spoiled everything,&rdquo; she accused herself
bitterly. &ldquo;Why did I have to go talking about the
orchard house at all? Everything was so jolly, so
right at last! Elsie was beginning to be more than
decent. What an idiot I am!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>She leaned her head down upon the arm of the
chair. Then the inner, more tranquil Kate came
forward. &ldquo;Think about the King of the Fairies,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Look as he looked, see as he saw. Perhaps
if you do, all this trouble will dissolve in light.
Get above the quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as she sat curled up there, she tried hard to
follow the inner Kate&rsquo;s directions. She tried to look
at the orchard with the different seeing. If she
followed the King of the Fairies&rsquo; directions, mightn&rsquo;t
she see the <i>all</i> of things as the girl and boy on the
fence had seen the all? She stayed very still, and
watched, expectantly.</p>
<p>Elsie came back to her, silent as a shadow. It was
almost as though she could read Kate&rsquo;s thoughts; for
she knelt down by her on the dewy grass, and putting
her face quite close to Kate&rsquo;s said in a low voice, but
earnestly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you this much, Kate Marshall,
<i>there is something fairyish about that little orchard
house</i>. If things fairyish show to you around it or
in it, it is because they <i>are there</i>. This is no lie. I
cross my heart. But you aren&rsquo;t wanted there. And
unless you are very mean you will keep your promise
to me and not go near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Elsie floated away, and was lost to Kate in
the garden shadows, like a fairyish thing herself.</p>
<p>Kate started up. Had she dreamed Elsie&rsquo;s coming
back, and her words? She had been in such a
<i>different</i> state of mind trying to see as the King of the
Fairies saw, that she hardly knew. Anyway, big
girl of fifteen that she was, she began looking again
toward the orchard house with deepened expectancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE MIRROR</span></h2>
<p>If Elsie had thought to tease or bewilder Kate in
the garden last night by asserting that fairies
actually had something to do with the orchard house
she would have been disappointed now if she could
read Kate&rsquo;s mind as she lay awake in the early
morning. A sense of something exciting in the day
had waked her before dawn. The excitement, of
course, was the party frock that Aunt Katherine had
promised her, and &ldquo;The Blue Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe that I am going to have such
a wonderful day,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Is it really happening
to me? Will the morning ever come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no idea what time it was but she could see
that the sky was beginning to lighten. She felt that
she could never go to sleep again and she felt very
hungry. Ah-ha! She remembered the gingerbread
man under her pillow. She had put it there simply
to hide it and meaning to get rid of it somehow without
Elsie or Bertha seeing. She had not thought she
would ever want to eat it! It was too childish. But
now she pulled it out, and leaning up on her elbow
ate every last crumb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>This elbow position brought the orchard into her
view, or rather its growing outlines in the approaching
dawn. She recalled last night and Elsie&rsquo;s emphatic
assurance that fairies somehow had a hand in the
mystery. Perhaps most other girls of fifteen would
simply have laughed at Elsie and not for an instant
accepted it as a possibility, fairies not entering into
their scheme of things. But fairies did enter into
Kate&rsquo;s scheme of things and always had. There she
was different. But there was a reason for her
difference.</p>
<p>When she was a little girl of seven she had seen
what she thought was a fairy; and it had made such
an impression on her mind that when she grew older
and came to the age of doubt she simply went on
knowing. She had seen what she had seen, and that
was all there was to it. Moreover, her mother had
seen it, too, or something like it. It was hardly
likely that both of them could have been utterly
deceived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It happened when she and Katherine had gone for
a walk on a June Saturday. They started very early
in the morning and walked very far, for a seven-year-old.
But it was Saturday and they were both free,
Kate from the lessons which her mother set her, and
Katherine from teaching. And it was June. So
they did not seem to get tired a bit, but walked and
walked, and explored. Toward noon they came to
a high meadow hilltop. There they lay down, flat
on their backs among the Queen Anne&rsquo;s lace, buttercups,
and daisies, their arms across their eyes, their
faces turned directly up toward the sun. It was
luncheon time, but they did not care. The sunshine
soaking into them and the smell of warm grass and
earth were better than food.</p>
<p>They lay still for a long time, not even speaking
to each other. Perhaps the little Kate slept. And
they thought of getting up and starting for home
only when the sun in the sky told Katherine that
it must be past two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Halfway down the hill pasture stood a little beach
wood. They took their way through that because it
looked so cool and inviting, and because Katherine
knew there was a spring there among some rocks
where they could get long, satisfying drinks of cold
water. It was there they saw the fairy. They saw
her just as they came out of the bright sunlight into
the green, cool shade of the wood and stood above the
water. She was at the other side of the spring facing
them. She was looking down at her reflection in the
water, not at all aware of their approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Kate saw her as a lovely girl in a floating green
garment. Her feet and arms were bare and shining
and it was their shining that made Kate know, even
in that first instant before the fairy had glanced up,
that she was unearthly. Kate and Katherine stood
as still as the leaves on the trees in that still wood,
awed and entranced. Then the little Kate whispered
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; and pointed. At that whisper the fairy
lifted her eyes. Kate saw the surprise in her eyes
and a dawning&mdash;something; was it friendliness, or a
smile? There was not time to know; for the fairy
flashed backward and up on to a stone behind her
across which the sunlight fell. And there she was lost
in the sunlight. They simply could not see her any
more.</p>
<p>But Kate had never forgotten that instant when
they stood looking at the fairy while she was plain to
view. And she had never forgotten the expression
on her mother&rsquo;s face after the fairy had vanished.
It was such a delighted expression, so startlingly
<i>satisfied</i>.</p>
<p>But that night, in talking it over, it came out that
mother and daughter had not seen exactly the same
thing. Katherine was sure that the being who had
stood looking down at the spring was taller than
human, grander, with a more tranquil, noble face,
And her garment, she said, was the colour of sunlight,
not green at all. Little Kate protested that.
No, she was just a slim girl and her garment was
green. Why, Kate remembered exactly how it hung
almost to her bare ankles, without fluttering or
motion in that still wood. The golden gown Katherine
had seen had blown back, she said, as in a
strong wind, although she herself felt no breath of air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The end of their discussion came to this. Katherine
said it might be that the sun in the high meadow
together with their having had no luncheon had made
them see not quite true. When they came suddenly
into the cool, green shaded wood out of the glare their
eyes played them tricks. What seemed like a person
standing above the spring may have been simply an
effect of sunlight striking through leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember, don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Katherine had ended,
&ldquo;how she vanished into sunlight when you said
&lsquo;Mother&rsquo;? Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katherine had left it at that. &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
But she had warned little Kate not to talk about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People will think I had no business letting you go
without luncheon so,&rdquo; she gave as her reason, laughingly.</p>
<p>But just because she had promised Katherine that
she would not talk about having seen a fairy, Kate
had thought about it all the more. And she never
went into a cool wood out of hot sunlight without
hoping to surprise a fairy again. What she had
seen she had seen, and that was all there was to it!</p>
<p>So now to Kate the thought that fairies might somehow
be connected with the little orchard house did
not seem at all an impossibility. Elsie certainly
had not acted or looked as though she were lying.
And it was perfectly true that from the minute Kate
herself had first caught sight of the orchard house
she had felt that there was something very special
about it&mdash;more special than just the fact that it was
the house where her mother had been born and grown
up and married. When Elsie called out &ldquo;Fairies,
beware! Orchard House, beware!&rdquo; Kate had been
pricked with the feeling of listening ears. She had
felt somehow that the warning was truly heard and
taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>She stretched now to her full length between her
scented sheets. &ldquo;I do wish the dawn would hurry
up and dawn!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;The minute it&rsquo;s a bit
light enough I&rsquo;ll get up, take a cold bath, dress, and
get out into the orchard. If fairies are there, dawn
ought to be as easy a time to see them as any. I&rsquo;ll
keep my promise about the key. But I&rsquo;ve a perfect
right in the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fell asleep then and dreamed about the orchard
house. The King of the Fairies was there, waiting
for her on the doorstep. She sat down beside him
and at once began to see things different, to see them,
as the King of the Fairies said, &ldquo;whole.&rdquo; There was
a lot to the dream&mdash;colour, adventure, and music,
and above all, the sight of things &ldquo;whole.&rdquo; But
Kate, when she woke, had quite lost it. The dream
had become just tag ends of brightness left floating
in her mind.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>To her surprise morning was fully established,
birds were singing in high chorus, and water was running
loudly into the tub!</p>
<p>Bertha appeared in the bathroom door. &ldquo;Miss
Elsie got ahead of us,&rdquo; she informed Kate brightly.
&ldquo;She must have been quieter than a mouse to have
had her bath and all and not waked you. Now I
suppose she&rsquo;s out in the orchard or somewhere. It&rsquo;s
a beautiful day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Oh, well, Kate did not allow herself to be downcast
at having missed dawn in the orchard. Not a bit of
it. What a day it was to be! The frock, &ldquo;The
Blue Bird,&rdquo; the whole day in Boston with Elsie, and
Aunt Katherine so friendly!</p>
<p>At her place at the little breakfast table under the
peach tree she found a letter from her mother. She
snatched it up and tore it open, hoping she could get
at least the heart out of it before Aunt Katherine and
Elsie should appear.</p>
<p>But she had hardly read the first sentence before
Miss Frazier came out through the breakfast-room
and Elsie floated from the direction of the orchard.
Kate was too absorbed to be aware of the approach
of either until she heard Elsie exclaim, &ldquo;Letters!
Oh, is there one for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s tone was surprisingly sharp when
she answered, &ldquo;You never get letters, Elsie. You
have hardly had one in the last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfair,&rdquo; Kate thought hotly. &ldquo;Aunt
thinks she&rsquo;s jealous even of my mail. And all the
time she&rsquo;s probably expecting an answer to that
special delivery she sent yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of the edge in Miss Frazier&rsquo;s voice
Elsie apparently was not at all dashed. To Kate&rsquo;s
curious eyes she looked just exactly as one might
who had been skylarking with fairies in the orchard
all early morning. She was ready to laugh, ready
to talk, ready to be friendly. Kate was profoundly
glad, for this kind of an Elsie argued well for the day
they were to have in Boston together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>They went by train because Miss Frazier herself
had uses for the car. Bertha was again dressed in
her correct gray tailored suit. &ldquo;Looking like an aunt
herself,&rdquo; Kate thought. Kate wore the blue silk
dress she had travelled in and the smart little hat
that was really her mother&rsquo;s. The white linen
would have done beautifully if they had not been
going to the theatre; but even though they were to
sit in the balcony&mdash;seats were sold out so far ahead
that this was the best Aunt Katherine had been able
to do for them&mdash;Kate thought the white linen would
hardly be appropriate for that, and Bertha had
agreed with her. Elsie, when she appeared, quite
took Kate&rsquo;s breath away. She was so lovely, but so
much older looking than she had been in her house
clothes. She was dressed in a straight little three-piece
silk suit of olive green. The rolling collar was
tied by a jaunty orange bow, and on the low belt of
the dress the same colour was embroidered in a conventional
flower pattern. The coat hung loosely
and very full, hooked together only at the collar.
The hat was a limp dark brown straw with olive-green
and orange embroidery all around the crown.
Elsie had pinned her curls up over her ears, and her
hair was a soft crushed aura under the hat. She
looked very much like a city girl but as though the
city might have been New York or Paris rather than
Boston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Kate gasped a little, and in her secret heart was
very glad she herself had decided on her silk. For a
little while she was constrained with Elsie, as though
Elsie had in fact become older suddenly just because
she looked older.</p>
<p>As they came through the gates at their terminal in
Boston Kate noticed a young man in a slouch brown
hat, a polka-dotted brown tie, and very shining pointed
brown shoes, standing about as though expecting
someone to meet him from the train on which they
had come in. Perhaps Kate noticed him so particularly
because he seemed to be noticing them so particularly,
especially Elsie. For the first time that
morning she remembered Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, the detective.
Was this one of his men, and was he going to &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;
them to-day? Kate was sure of it when out of
the tail of her eye she saw him wheel and follow at a
little distance as they moved toward the taxi stand.
He stood prepared to take the next cab that should
move into position as theirs moved out. Kate hardly
understood her own emotions at that moment. Her
cheeks were hot and her knees shook a little. She
was resentful for Elsie. Why was she being shadowed
by a detective as though she were a criminal?
Why had Aunt Katherine let this happen?</p>
<p>Madame Pearl&rsquo;s establishment was a narrow
three-story house on Beacon Street. &ldquo;Madame
Pearl&rdquo; was engraved on a plate above the bell, nothing
more. A daintily capped and aproned maid
answered their ring. She knew their names before
they had given them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Misses Frazier,&rdquo; she said, speaking with a
distinct accent. &ldquo;You have an engagement, and
Madame Pearl is expecting. Please come this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The front door opened directly into a long narrow
room, panelled in ivory, decorated with wreathed
cupids and flowers. The floor was cool gray and the
hangings at the long windows at the end of the room
were gray, too, silvery. But under their feet were
warm-coloured Persian rugs of the most beautiful
shades and designs. There were little tables in the
room with magazines and books scattered on them,
a few easy chairs, and two long divans. In one
corner by the window there was an exquisite little
writing desk of Italian workmanship. On this stood
a vase of very red roses.</p>
<p>Kate glanced about with surprised eyes. But
Elsie, who had been here before with Aunt Katherine,
nonchalantly followed the maid who was guiding
them. Kate had expected to find herself in a shop.
But there was no evidence of things for sale here.
And they had an appointment! Whoever heard of
having an appointment in a shop?</p>
<p>The maid stood back at the foot of a narrow spiral
staircase at the back of the room. The girls and
Bertha ascended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Still no sign of a shop, or dresses for sale. This
long upper room was simply a boudoir with chaises-longues,
mirrors, and flowers. Madame Pearl swept
to meet them. She was a regal little lady in trailing
gray chiffon. The gown had long flowing sleeves
that just escaped the floor. Miss Frazier had told
Kate at breakfast that morning that Madame Pearl
was really a Russian princess who had escaped at the
time of the Revolution and in just a few years had
made a fortune with this shop. Her real name was
Olga Schwankovsky. So Kate looked at her with
intense curiosity now. But where was the shop?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Frazier has telephoned,&rdquo; Madame Pearl
said in the sweetest of voices and almost perfect
accent. &ldquo;You young ladies are to have party
dresses, your first party dresses. Very simple, very
chic, youthful. We must not hurry but give time to
it and consideration. If you will be so kind as to
come this way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way&rdquo; was all down the room to a wider
alcove, walled on the street by big plate-glass windows
and on the two other sides by huge, perfect
mirrors.</p>
<p>There Madame Pearl asked them to be seated.
She herself sat comfortably among cushions on a little
lounge. She inquired as to their favourite colours.
From that the conversation expanded to their other
tastes, to books, music. Elsie told about their plan
for the afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are to see &lsquo;The Blue Bird&rsquo;!&rdquo; Madame
Pearl exclaimed. &ldquo;That will be an experience. I
myself saw it when I was about your age&mdash;its first
production at the Moscow Art Theatre. I had never
dreamed anything could be so beautiful. You will
think so, too.&rdquo; Then she added, sighing a little,
&ldquo;But it cannot be quite the same. Stanislavsky
produced it as it never could be produced by another.
It was superb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw it, there, when it was given in Moscow
that first time?&rdquo; Elsie breathed, sitting on the very
edge of her chair, her cheeks pink with excitement.
&ldquo;That was wonderful. I know, for my fa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
stopped, bit her lip, and continued: &ldquo;Someone
showed me photographs of the stage sets and costumes
once. I am wondering if it will be anything
like that here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Madame Pearl replied. &ldquo;But I
tell you frankly I am not going to see. For the
memory of our Art Theatre production is too vivid
for me to want to expose it to any comparison. It
was done with a richness, a depth, a true sense of
mysticism&mdash;&mdash; What shall I say? It was so free
of sentimentality. I confess I do not care to see it
attempted again. It had an effect on me, that
play. An effect that is lasting, that runs through&mdash;how
shall I say?&mdash;my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded and looked at Kate. She said, &ldquo;Yes,
we understand. &lsquo;The King of the Fairies&rsquo; is like that,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart leapt. At last those two girls had met
face to face, comrades on common ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The King of the Fairies,&rsquo;&rdquo; Madame Pearl murmured,
reflectively. &ldquo;Ah, yes. I have heard of that
book. Published last year. Very beautiful, I have
heard. And literary people are surprised because it
is so popular. They alone, when they discovered it,
expected to appreciate it and enjoy. They are a
little annoyed that children and simple people and
the unliterary love it, too, that it is a &lsquo;best seller.&rsquo;
I have guessed, though I have not yet read it, that
that book must tap some deep wells of truth that all
humanity knows, even the simple. I have a theory
about art&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There the beautiful voice ceased abruptly. Madame
Pearl rose, smiling enigmatically. &ldquo;This is
not choosing frocks, is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But while we
have chattered I have studied your types. I have
not been idle. Shall we begin with the one of which
I am the least sure? That is Miss Kate. We may
have to try several frocks before we are suited for
you. But I think we shall begin with an orange
cr&ecirc;pe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pearl touched a button in the wall and almost
instantly a maid appeared, not the one who had
answered the door, but identically dressed. She was
young and pretty and very quick in all her motions.
Kate found a screen placed around her almost before
she knew what was happening. It was a light folding
screen made of gray silk and bamboo and embroidered
with oriental flowers. Bertha hastened to
disrobe her. Then she came forth and stood ready
to try on before one of the huge mirrors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Panels in the wall were slid back and the little
maid brought the dresses from their hiding places one
by one. Bertha and the little maid slipped them
over her head, fastened them, turned her around
lightly by the shoulders. Then everyone looked
at Madame Pearl. She was sitting on her couch
again, her eyes intent. She studied Kate as an
artist studies his picture. And to every frock, when
it was on and Kate had been turned quite around
once or twice, she shook her head decidedly. None of
them, not one would do.</p>
<p>Kate herself could not see why. There was not
one that was positively unbecoming, and three or
four had been quite lovely. She was growing dazed
and tired. The sparkle and colour of the frocks
heaped about her on chairs and thrown over the
screen was almost too much for her eyes. She
thought of the Arabian Nights and imagined herself
a young princess of Arabia being decked for her
wedding. But even as the corners of her mouth
lifted with this dream she was startled by an exclamation
from Madame Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last! It is perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate turned to herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>But was it Kate Marshall at all? She scarcely
knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The frock was yellow, of softest satin, the color of a
crocus. At the rounded neck it was gathered softly
to a narrow border of tiny pearl-white and blue
blossoms made in satin. At the low waistline the
satin was gathered again at a girdle of the same
exquisitely fashioned flowers, four wreaths of them
loosely twined. The skirt swung out from this girdle
very full and straight, stopping just a little above the
ankles, quite the longest skirt Kate had ever had.
The border of the skirt was cut in deep, sharp scallops
showing an underskirt below of foaming, creamy lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Madame Pearl asked, interestedly.
Kate was looking at herself without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help liking it,&rdquo; Kate replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
beautiful. But&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t look exactly as though
we belonged&mdash;it and I together! It is fluffy! So
delicate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fault of your hair, the short bob,&rdquo;
Madame Pearl assured her. &ldquo;There must be a cap.&rdquo;
She gave directions to the maid. &ldquo;The silver cap
with the star points. Yes, the one from Riis&rsquo;s.
Deep cream stockings. And the pumps&mdash;but I see
you know which pumps that frock must have yourself.
I think they will fit, too. Fetch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid whisked away to return in a minute with
silk stockings, satin slippers, and a silver cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your feet first,&rdquo; Madame Pearl said, quite excitedly.
&ldquo;The cap we will leave for the finishing
touch. Then you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, almost in a daze, Kate vanished behind the
painted screen accompanied by both Bertha and
the maid. Each of them dressed a foot, and it was
done in a minute. The pumps were an exact fit.
They were creamy satin embroidered in deeper
creamy-coloured flowers. At the side of each a
small diamond-shaped crystal buckle caught the
light in many facets. The heels were low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Kate was troubled. &ldquo;My aunt is only giving me
the frock,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t mention slippers
and things. I&rsquo;ve some perfectly good black patent-leather
pumps, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black pumps! With that frock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pearl gazed at her in horror. Bertha
hurriedly interposed, &ldquo;Miss Frazier impressed it on
me that the costumes were to be complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Madame Pearl arose from the couch and
herself set the silver cap on Kate&rsquo;s head. It was a
saucy affair fashioned in crisp silver lace with five
star points radiating from its crown. The cap was
indeed the finishing touch. It accomplished almost
a transformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m <i>pretty</i>, awfully pretty!&rdquo; Kate exclaimed
to herself, gazing into the mirror. But
then more modestly, she added, &ldquo;Any one would be
in that fascinating cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Kate was ready for the party! Let it come!</p>
<p>And now it was Elsie&rsquo;s turn. But Madame Pearl
had no trouble in fitting Elsie to just the right frock.
In fact, she had decided which it must be in the first
minutes while they sat discussing &ldquo;The Blue Bird.&rdquo;
Elsie was not &ldquo;difficult.&rdquo; Madame Pearl whispered
to the maid, who scurried away. She returned
bearing over her arm a cloud of green chiffon. While
Kate was being dressed behind her screen Elsie was
put into this green creation behind another similar
screen. She appeared before Kate was done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Her frock was simplicity itself, just straight
lengths of green chiffon falling straight away from
her slim shoulders. As she moved back and forth
in front of the mirror her draperies floated about
her like filmiest clouds. When she stood still they
fell straight and sheer almost to her ankles. Madame
Pearl signalled and the maid took the pins from
Elsie&rsquo;s curls and they tumbled, a shower of sunlight.</p>
<p>The effect was perfect. Madame Pearl breathed
softly: &ldquo;I am satisfied. Exquisitely.&rdquo; She determined
that white kid sandals, sandals in the Greek
style, were the footwear the frock required. She had
them, too, stored somewhere behind those secret
panels. The maid hurried off, and Elsie in preparation
for her return slipped off the black patent-leather
sandals she was wearing, and out of her stockings.</p>
<p>At the same time Madame Pearl moved to the big
windows. &ldquo;The light is glaring,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;and it is unreasonably hot.&rdquo; Untying a cord at
the side of the sash she let down green inner blinds.
Elsie rose, and stood in her bare feet facing herself
meditatively in the mirror. At that instant Kate
came from behind her screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; It was almost a shriek. Kate actually
reeled against Bertha who was following her and
clutched for support. Bertha led her to the couch.
&ldquo;Water, a glass of cold water quickly,&rdquo; Madame
Pearl commanded the little maid. Elsie ran to Kate
and knelt before her, taking her hands. &ldquo;Kate,
Kate,&rdquo; she called as though Kate were running away
from her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>But Kate was not a girl to faint easily. She
straightened up now and took a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only the way you looked in the glass, Elsie,&rdquo; she
explained, shakily. &ldquo;The room just went spinning
when I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The way she looked in the glass!&rsquo;&rdquo; Madame
Pearl cast a hurried glance toward the big mirror
that now reflected only Kate&rsquo;s array of discarded
dresses, a few tables and chairs.</p>
<p>But Kate explained further, looking at Elsie
wanly: &ldquo;You were the fairy&mdash;the fairy that Mother
and I saw by the pool that day. You were the fairy
exactly, even the expression on your face when you
looked at me! And the green light&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pearl laughed. &ldquo;The green light is only
because I pulled the blind. But you are right, Miss
Elsie does look exactly like some fairy, some wood
fairy. Perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not some fairy, <i>the fairy</i>. I have remembered
perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pearl spoke to Bertha aside, but Kate
heard well enough. &ldquo;It was the heat, and she
was tired from trying on. She ought to lie
down.&rdquo; Then she turned her attention to Elsie&rsquo;s
sandals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But Elsie kept looking back over her shoulder at
Kate, resting on the sofa&mdash;questioningly. She was
speculating: &ldquo;Had Kate taken her hint of fairies
in the orchard house seriously? Was it so much on
her mind that she was imagining things? Or had
Kate once really seen a fairy, and Elsie in the mirror
had reminded her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they left the shop and stood on the step
looking about for a taxi Elsie asked Kate eagerly,
&ldquo;Did you really see a fairy once? Where? When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother and I. But we both saw it differently.
And now&mdash;now, how could it have been a
fairy? Why, it was <i>you</i>. But I promised Mother
not to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of Kate&rsquo;s mother the cold look
came back to Elsie&rsquo;s face. She turned away with
feigned indifference while Bertha lifted her hand to
summon a taxi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KATE TAKES THE HELM</span></h2>
<p>But the taxi driver Bertha had signalled shook
his head, giving a sidewise jerk toward the
back of his cab to indicate that he had a fare. There
was the young man of the brown hat and polka-dotted
tie looking away as though he was not one bit
aware of them and smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why do they stand still, then!&rdquo; Bertha
complained. &ldquo;How could I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at once, however, another taxi came
cruising up the hill, and they were soon in, whirling
away toward Miss Frazier&rsquo;s club. It was now almost
one o&rsquo;clock, and they were quite ready for
luncheon.</p>
<p>Though Kate did not actually lean out to see
whether the detective&rsquo;s taxi was following, she felt
quite sure that it was. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll be wherever we
go all day,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;What does he expect
us to do&mdash;or Elsie, rather? What <i>could</i> she do with
Bertha and me along, anyway? It&rsquo;s all just too
curious! And I don&rsquo;t like it a bit. It makes me
angry for Elsie. It isn&rsquo;t fair to her! I wonder what
Mother and the boys would think if they knew I
was riding around Boston to-day, buying gorgeous
clothes, conversing with princesses, almost fainting,
and being shadowed by a detective!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Both girls, lunching in Miss Frazier&rsquo;s club, felt
themselves quite emancipated, really adult! Elsie
wrote out their orders on a little pad tendered by a
gray-clad waitress, and acted hostess throughout.
Kate very much admired her worldly air, her poise
and decision, and the way she knew the French names
for things. Apparently she was quite accustomed
to such complicated menus. Kate was proud of
Elsie, proud and stirred. Aunt Katherine herself
could not have conducted things better.</p>
<p>They discussed Madame Pearl and her establishment.
They were both enchanted by her, and full of
surmises about her life. Miss Frazier had told them
that people knew very little about Madame Pearl&rsquo;s
experiences during the Revolution and her escape,
because she meant to keep out of the papers. That
was why she had taken the name Madame Pearl, and
did not want to be known as a princess at all, except
to a few trusted customers, or rather patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She prescribes clothes just as a doctor prescribes
pills, Aunt Katherine says,&rdquo; Elsie remarked, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think my dress is too wonderful,&rdquo; Kate sighed.
&ldquo;But do you know I am afraid Mother won&rsquo;t want
me to wear it to high-school dances next winter, if I
go to any. She will say it&rsquo;s too grand, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>In time, however, they left the topic of clothes and
launched into discussion of &ldquo;The Blue Bird.&rdquo; Both
had read it, but in quite different ways. Kate had
read for the story, and Elsie to fit it to the photographs
she had seen of its first production in Moscow.
In fact, this was typical of these two girls. They had
enthusiasm for the same things, but approached
them from different angles. That was why, when
they found themselves talking freely, the air fairly
sparkled between them. They opened new avenues
of thought to each other, took each other&rsquo;s old ideas
and spun them like balls, showing new sides and
colours. They were animated. They leaned toward
each other over the table, their faces alive and
bright with thinking. Bertha remained mostly
silent, enjoying her luncheon and the interested and
appreciative glances that were turned from every
direction upon her charges.</p>
<p>Luncheon went on slow feet because of conversation&rsquo;s
wings. But they did not in any way neglect
it. It was a most delicious meal, and quite a complicated
one, because Miss Frazier had given Elsie carte
blanche and told her to make it just as splendid as
she pleased. After the ice they had a demitasse.
Neither of the girls was accustomed to coffee, but
this was a special day and they would do special
things. Besides, the waitress seemed to expect it
of them. It tasted horrible. But each made a
brave effort and drank down the tiny portion without
grimacing.</p>
<p>Now for the theatre!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>At the door of the club a footman summoned a
taxi for them. As Kate went down the steps and
got in she looked all about for signs of the detective
but saw none. However, they were in a crowded
section, taxis and autos moving in two rivers, one
north, one south, and the sidewalks were two more
rivers&mdash;rivers of human beings. That polka-dotted
young man might well have his eye on them from
some station in that flow of life and Kate never be
aware.</p>
<p>Elsie had the theatre tickets in her purse, and took
them out now to be sure about them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in
the third row in the first balcony,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Aunt
Katherine thought they weren&rsquo;t very good, but I
am sure they are. Why, it will be even better than
as though we were &rsquo;way up front downstairs. We
will get all the effects better. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
But she asked a trifle anxiously, as though trying to
console herself.</p>
<p>Kate agreed, though to speak truth she knew very
little indeed about the theatre and could hardly be
considered a judge in any way. Both girls were
glowing with anticipation and excitement. Kate
felt that it was all simply too wonderful to be true.
Her heart was almost breaking with happiness&mdash;at
least, that is what she told herself was the matter
with it. It certainly was pounding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>But arrived in the palace of gold decoration and
purple plush which was the theatre, and ushered to
their seats, there was an unpleasant surprise. One
of the seats was directly behind a large ornate post!
Whoever sat there would have to do a great deal of
craning and stretching to see the stage at all, and
not for one instant would she be able to see its
entirety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bother,&rdquo; Bertha reassured them, concealing
her own deep disappointment. &ldquo;Of course
I shall sit there. It&rsquo;s only a pity it&rsquo;s between you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Elsie showed a new side of her character to
Kate, and a side that she had not suspected. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be silly,&rdquo; she told Bertha emphatically&mdash;but not
rudely, merely affectionately&mdash;&ldquo;Of course we shall
take turns. I shall have the post for half the time
and you the other. But it&rsquo;s mean, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, too&mdash;I shall certainly take my turn,&rdquo; Kate
threw in. &ldquo;But I think it is mean, and a cheat, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are the guest,&rdquo; Elsie said firmly. &ldquo;You
are to sit at the end and stay there. Go in now and
I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate did not pass in. She stood frowning.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;They had no business
to sell Aunt Katherine that seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha shrugged. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s unfair,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nothing to do about it.&rdquo; She
was bothered by the attention they were beginning to
attract. She wished Kate would go in and sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we ought to complain,&rdquo; Kate insisted, still
blocking up the aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; Bertha asked. Her tone said <i>she</i>
would have nothing to do with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Elsie murmured quickly, &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; and gave
Kate a slight push. She, too, was conscious of their
conspicuous situation. &ldquo;<i>I couldn&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate, too, knew that they were attracting the
attention of many people. All the more she was
determined not to accept the injustice of that post
seat meekly. They were early; the curtain would
not go up for ten minutes. The orchestra was only
just coming into the pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go in and sit down. But give me the ticket
stubs. I&rsquo;ll make them fix this up.&rdquo; Kate did not
whisper or even lower her voice. She spoke calmly,
with assurance. Underneath she was as diffident
as the other two, but hers was not a nature to
tolerate such injustice supinely.</p>
<p>Elsie, with one quick, surprised glance, thrust the
stubs into this country cousin&rsquo;s hand, and Kate was
off up the steep aisle, bent on business. When she
had pushed her way through the incoming crowds
out into the upper foyer the first thing she saw was
the detective, leaning against the wall trying to look
unconcerned and as though he belonged there. In
spite of the crowds their eyes happened to meet.
Kate&rsquo;s cool look said, &ldquo;So you are here.&rdquo; Then she
turned away and fought her passage down the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>The young man scowled. Well, this was not the
niece he was to watch. She had light curls, and his
chief had said she would be wearing a green silk
suit. Even so this bobbed-haired one was of the
party. He was troubled by her movements. What
was she leaving her seat for? Where was she going?
He really ought to find out, but, on the other hand, if
he forsook his post here he might miss Miss Elsie if
she should come out. No, he must stay, but it was
annoying all the same.</p>
<p>At the box office they were turning people away.
&ldquo;No seats left,&rdquo; Kate heard on every side. But that
did not stop her. &ldquo;They can put a chair in the
aisle,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;They <i>must</i> do something.
People should have what they pay for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man at the ticket window gave her no
hope. &ldquo;All sold out,&rdquo; he assured her before she had
had time to say a word. When he heard her complaint
he merely said, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll give you your
money back. I could sell that post seat a hundred
times over in the next five minutes. All you need
is to <i>lean</i> a little. Where&rsquo;s your stub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the money,&rdquo; Kate protested. &ldquo;I
want to see the play. It was a cheat, selling a seat
like that. I want another one. In fact, I want three
other seats, for we have to sit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed, much amused at that. And
several by-standers laughed, too. Kate&rsquo;s cheeks
fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can I find the manager?&rdquo; she asked,
straightening her spine and looking hard at the
amused young man.</p>
<p>The man strangled his laugh and pointed across
the lobby to a door marked &ldquo;Private.&rdquo; &ldquo;There, if
he&rsquo;s in. Much good it&rsquo;ll do you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>As Kate left the window and crossed to the door
indicated she heard several titters. That made her
determination deeper. She knocked firmly right in
the middle of the word &ldquo;Private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she got no answer to her knocking she followed
her usual course when uncertain, or embarrassed&mdash;abrupt
action. In this instance she simply opened
the door and stepped in. She did this in exactly the
way she often spoke when she had no intention of
speaking. A man turned from a window where he
was leaning looking down into the crowded street
watching the people flooding to &ldquo;The Blue Bird.&rdquo;
He was a youngish man with nice lines around his
eyes, smiling lines. But the eyes were very keen.
Whether he was truly the manager or not Kate never
learned, but he was manager enough for her purposes.
She told him her grievance. He listened respectfully
without a word until she had finished. Then, still
without a word to her, he took up a telephone instrument
from his desk and spoke briskly into it: &ldquo;Box
office, any seats left?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s fine.
Give the young lady who was at your window a minute
ago one in the lower left.&rdquo; He hung up and
turned to Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house is sold out,&rdquo; he informed her in a
voice that was fairly jubilant. &ldquo;And they said it
couldn&rsquo;t be done in the States in summer!&rdquo; She
felt that he wanted to dance and was constrained only
by her presence. &ldquo;All except a few box seats. They
come too high. You can get yours now at the office
all right. I&rsquo;ve fixed it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>But Kate did not move to go. &ldquo;There are three
of us,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We have to stay together.
We are with a chaperon. You hung up before I
could tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager was dashed. He had expected gratitude.
&ldquo;With a chaperon? Why isn&rsquo;t she here fixing
things instead of you, then?&rdquo; he asked with reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t like to. She was willing to sit
behind the post. She&rsquo;s really my cousin&rsquo;s maid,
but my aunt lets her chaperon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; There was something of humorous
admiration in the manager&rsquo;s voice now. He liked
Kate&rsquo;s spirit. He snatched up the telephone again.
&ldquo;Three seats for that lady just mentioned,&rdquo; he
commanded into it. &ldquo;Front ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kate did thank him and smiled&mdash;her
peculiar, charming smile. He responded to it with a
beam of his own. But her last words were, &ldquo;It was a
cheat, wasn&rsquo;t it, selling that post seat to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reply was simply &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; as he held the door
for her. She had read enough to know by his use of
that word that he was English. He had spoken his
&ldquo;rather&rdquo; in the most natural, sincere way possible.</p>
<p>The box-office man eyed her with respect. &ldquo;Never
thought you&rsquo;d turn the trick,&rdquo; he said, admiringly.
But Kate did not deign to answer. Suddenly she
felt her conspicuousness too keenly. She took the
tickets he offered her and fled away up the stairs, not
looking at any one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>In the upper foyer the detective was on the watch
for her. He sighed with relief when she appeared
and vanished again through the swinging doors into
the balcony. Well, his &ldquo;party&rdquo; was safe now until
after the play. It was unfortunate that he had not
been able to secure a seat inside where he could keep
his eye on them directly. When the curtain went up
he would slip in and stand in the back, of course.
After all, things were pretty satisfactory. They
certainly couldn&rsquo;t escape his attention now. So
far their doings had been innocent enough, all except
that little excursion of the bobbed-haired one. Had
she taken a note to someone? Perhaps he had been
foolish not to follow her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seats in a box! Oh, Kate, how did you ever!&rdquo;
Elsie looked at Kate with sincerest admiration shining
in her eyes, and Kate felt for ever repaid for all
her effort. If Elsie had acquitted herself well at
luncheon, Kate had surely acquitted herself well
here. They were equals. Comrades?</p>
<p>An usher hurried toward them as they came out
into the aisle. &ldquo;The curtain is about to go up,&rdquo; she
warned. She felt, perhaps, that they had already
made too much disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we have seats down in a box,&rdquo; Kate said
with composure. The usher reached her hand for
the tickets. &ldquo;This way, then. There are stairs
behind these curtains. If you hurry you&rsquo;ll be there
before the lights go out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, Mr. Detective!&rdquo; Kate laughed to herself
as she felt her way down the narrow, velvet-carpeted
stairs. &ldquo;You are losing us now. You&rsquo;ll watch up
there in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their seats were quite perfect, almost on the stage,
three chairs in the very front of the best box in the
house, three throne-like chairs with gilded arms and
cushioned backs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be more dressed,&rdquo; Bertha whispered,
a little uneasily, as in their conspicuous position she
felt that the eyes of the whole great audience were
upon them. But Elsie laughed softly. &ldquo;Who cares!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t Aunt Katherine be surprised
when she hears of all this state!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Music. The asbestos curtain rolling up, revealing
night-coloured velvet curtains with a huge gold
shield. Lights out. The two girls, recently so
estranged, were for the hours of this play closest
sisters. In Fairyland all are friends. They gripped
hands. Soon they simply sat close together, arm-in-arm,
entranced. The theatre, the huge audience,
dissolved for them in mist. The stage was not a
stage. They were moving with Mytil and Tyltyl
through frightening or lovely or saddening scenes,
all equally enthralling. They were moving bodiless.
They <i>were</i> Tyltyl and Mytil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Not until the very last minute of the play, when the
night-coloured curtains had drawn together for the
last time and the blue bird was at large again, perhaps
somewhere in the upper reaches of the gilded theatre,
did the girls again take up their habitations in their
own minds and bodies. They looked at each other
then and sighed, waking as from a dream they had
shared. Bertha was quite pale with emotion and surreptitiously
wiping away her tears.</p>
<p>The first waking thought that Kate had was
gratefulness that Bertha had seen the play as it ought
to be seen and not cut in two by a post, since she
cared for it so much.</p>
<p>All three were almost silent on the journey to the
station, wrapped in the afterglow of the play&rsquo;s
thraldom. But just outside the gates of the train
shed Elsie looked all about and asked a question:
&ldquo;That young man in the polka-dotted tie seems to have
disappeared,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;He was here when
we came, outside of Madame Pearl&rsquo;s in that taxi, in
the hallway to the club and upstairs at the theatre.
What&rsquo;s happened to him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you notice him, too?&rdquo; Kate asked, surprised.
&ldquo;And in the club? I missed him there.
How did he get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was talking to the telephone girl and watching
us while we had lunch. I saw through the door. He
acted like a detective, or something. I was going to
point him out to you, and then every time I got
interested in what we were saying and forgot. What
do you suppose he was doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was suddenly embarrassed. She knew very
well what he was doing, but of course she was bound
not to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted like a detective,&rdquo; Elsie said, musingly.
&ldquo;Just exactly the way they act in books.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And we might have been thieves, or something,&rdquo;
Kate took it up.</p>
<p>But at her words Elsie stiffened. Although Kate
at the minute was not looking at her she <i>felt</i> the
stiffening. And when they were established in their
coach and Kate did turn to look at Elsie she saw at
once that the comrade had vanished again! What
<i>had</i> she done? And how could she bear it after this
perfect day? Oh, no, it was not to be borne. Things
couldn&rsquo;t happen like that. She leaned toward Elsie
and spoke quickly, urgently but softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get icy again,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve
offended you, I truly don&rsquo;t know how. And we&rsquo;ve
had such a splendid day of it. Deep down everything
seems to be all right with us. It&rsquo;s only on top things
keep going wrong. Don&rsquo;t look like that. Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elsie did not respond to Kate&rsquo;s pleading. She
kept on looking &ldquo;like that&rdquo; and merely commented
coldly, &ldquo;You do say such queer things. I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from then on Elsie, dropping all her city bearing,
curled one foot up under her on the car seat,
turned her shoulder to Kate, leaned her chin on her
hand, and gazed out of the window. Kate sat biting
her lips with clutched hands. After a while, when
she realized that Elsie&rsquo;s &ldquo;cold shoulder&rdquo; was to be
permanent, she got up and crossed the aisle to sit
by herself at a window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I not furious with her?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;She has no right to treat me like that!
And I am angry, of course. But I&rsquo;m not <i>very</i> angry.
Why am I not very angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion she finally arrived at was that she
couldn&rsquo;t be very angry until she understood what it
was all about. There was a mystery that needed
solving. Kate felt herself destined to solve it.
There was an elation in that prospect that bore her
up above the moment&rsquo;s worries and confusions.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to live you&rsquo;ve got to be willing to
suffer,&rdquo; she told herself sententiously. &ldquo;And certainly
I am living!&rdquo; Then her eyes crinkled into
their nicest Chinese smile. For Kate was perfectly
capable of being amused at herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SPECIAL DELIVERY</span></h2>
<p>Miss Frazier approved, and was even delighted
with the frocks when she came up to
view them after breakfast next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try them on for you?&rdquo; Kate offered
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe so. I can trust Madame
Pearl, I am sure, to say nothing of you girls yourselves!
And there is a lot to be done now to get ready
for the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier was moving and speaking in suppressed
excitement, any one could see that. This
party to her was to be a significant moment in her
own life as well as in the girls&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; Kate asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may help me to decorate the drawing-room
and hall. If I engage a professional person he will
simply load the whole place with flowers in a set and
stuffy way. Besides, this is an informal party, and
we want the decorations to be very simple and unstudied.&rdquo;
Then Miss Frazier added with a twinkle
in her eye, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we must study very hard
and fuss and consult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls laughed at that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting a man now to help Timothy move
the furniture back for dancing. As soon as they are
done we can begin. The dresses are charming, and I
congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since getting into the train the afternoon before
the comrade in Elsie had not been visible. The girls
had spoken to each other only in monosyllables and
with eyes usually averted. Almost as though they
had agreed upon it, however, they played up a little
in the presence of their aunt. She had been so kind
to them and counted so much on the day together to
have made them friends, they had not the heart to
let her see just how things stood between them. So
at dinner they had told her of the day&rsquo;s adventures
vivaciously, dwelling most on their reactions to &ldquo;The
Blue Bird&rdquo; and the episode of the post. For some
reason Elsie did not mention the young man who had
shadowed them in such an unshadowy way. That
omission surprised Kate and gave her pause. What
did such reticence mean? Aunt Katherine had been
much diverted by Kate&rsquo;s account of her interview
with the box-office clerk and the manager. Her
comment had been, &ldquo;You are a Frazier, Kate! You
have a <i>spine</i>. I imagine the manager sensed that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>After dinner the three had settled to a quite exciting
game of Mah Jong. No need for Elsie and Kate
to pretend friendliness then, for the game took all
their attention, and they could forget each other as
persons. After that there was a brief stroll in the
garden, Aunt Katherine walking between the girls,
their arms drawn through hers. It had all seemed
very peaceful and congenial. But there had been
no &ldquo;good-nights&rdquo; upstairs, though in accordance
with Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s will the doors stood open
between the two bedrooms.</p>
<p>So now, when Aunt Katherine left to attend to the
moving of the furniture, Kate turned to Bertha and
said, &ldquo;I shall be in the garden over by the Dentons&rsquo;
hedge, writing letters. Will you call me when Miss
Frazier is ready, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a glance at Elsie she picked up her pad
and hurried out. She hoped that Elsie realized she
was avoiding using the sitting-room and the desk they
were supposed to share; and she would not have
minded knowing that Elsie&rsquo;s conscience bothered her
about it. But if it did, Elsie gave no sign. She
herself simply turned away about some business of
her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>There was so much for Kate to tell her mother in
this letter that was interesting and wonderful! First,
of course, there was Madame Pearl and her most
unique shop that didn&rsquo;t look like a shop a bit. She
must describe the frocks they had chosen, or rather
that Madame Pearl had chosen for them; Kate
realized now that they themselves had done no choosing
at all. Then dining in the luxurious club&mdash;she
would describe that in detail. She had never in her
life had quite such a stimulating conversation with
any one before as that conversation at luncheon.
She recalled it now as an hour during which she had
<i>thought</i>, and thought rapidly, and expressed her
thoughts to an attentive listener who in her turn
<i>thought</i> and came back at her in a most provocative
manner. Ideas had spun in the air between them
like iridescent bubbles, changing colour as they
turned and you viewed different sides of them. The
truth about that was that two most congenial minds
had discovered each other, and that is as exciting an
adventure as there is in the world, and not at all an
ordinary one. The thing that gave this experience
its final tang was that the two minds, though comprehending
each other perfectly, worked entirely differently.
It followed that for each other they had great
discoveries and surprises. Together they danced as
one in figures new to both!&mdash;Of course, Kate could
not tell her mother exactly this, but she could tell
her enough so that she would understand a little
what had happened. But she must begin.</p>
<p>Instead, unhygienically, she sucked the end of her
pencil.</p>
<p>Would Mother approve of her having accepted the
party frock? That bothered her a little. Knowing
Aunt Katherine now she understood her mother
much less than ever before on these points. The
dress must have cost&mdash;no, she would not imagine
what it must have cost since Aunt Katherine had
told her not to give that end of it a thought. Still,
she would describe the dress to Mother, and she
could come to conclusions for herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Mother&rdquo;:&mdash;Oh, there was so much, so
very much, it was quite hopeless to write! There
was the fairy in the glass. That must be told first.
There was not the slightest doubt in Kate&rsquo;s mind
that the two were exactly the same, the fairy in the
woods that day and the reflection of Elsie in the
mirror at Madame Pearl&rsquo;s. But what its explanation
could be was unthinkable. At the time the
little Kate had seen the fairy in the woods, Elsie was
only a little girl of her own age. How, then, had
Kate seen her as she would look eight years later
in a mirror in a Boston shop? It was such an unanswerable
question that Kate&rsquo;s mind turned away
from it. Still, not for one minute did she doubt that
the two visions had been exactly the same. What
would Katherine make of it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. Good morning.&rdquo; Jack Denton, in white
flannels, tall and athletic, was standing the other side
of the hedge, swinging his tennis racket and smiling a
friendly, frank smile. &ldquo;Excuse me, but you&rsquo;re Miss
Kate Marshall, aren&rsquo;t you? My sister and I are
coming to the party in your honour to-night. I&rsquo;m
Jack Denton, and Rose will be out in a minute. If
you&rsquo;ll play a set with us I&rsquo;ll call up another fellow and
make doubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate jumped up, delighted. She went to the wall.
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was just beginning
a letter. But I&rsquo;d love to play&mdash;that is, for a little
while, till Aunt Katherine needs me. But why don&rsquo;t
we just shout for Elsie? She likes tennis, I know,
and Aunt Katherine says she plays wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>But Jack&rsquo;s expression had changed queerly. He
grew slightly red and avoided looking directly at
Kate. &ldquo;No need to get any one yet,&rdquo; he objected.
&ldquo;Heaven knows when Rose will be out. She&rsquo;s awfully
pokey&mdash;slow. Let us begin just by ourselves till she
does appear, anyway. Can you jump? Here&rsquo;s a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate shook her head. &ldquo;No, thanks. I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll play, after all. I may be called any minute
to help Aunt Katherine, and besides&mdash;besides, it&rsquo;s
very warm, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was looking at the pad in her hand, about to
turn away.</p>
<p>But Jack kept her a minute. &ldquo;Oh, I say! You
aren&rsquo;t offended, are you? I wouldn&rsquo;t do that for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; But Kate&rsquo;s negation was
made only out of a spirit of reserve and also embarrassment.
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are, and I don&rsquo;t wonder. Of course
you&rsquo;d be on your cousin&rsquo;s side. And listen. We are,
too. Rose and I and all of us are, always have been.
We never could see any sense in all the hubbub. It&rsquo;s
just been Grandmother and Grandmother&rsquo;s friends.
We all thought Elsie was great stuff when she visited
Miss Frazier before&mdash;&mdash; And we&rsquo;re coming to the
party to-night, you bet. Only&mdash;at this minute
Grandmother is sitting right up there in a window
where she can see the court, and it might change her,
decide her for some reason not to go to-night. She
feels that her going formally and giving in, as it were,
publicly, is the thing that&rsquo;s going to turn the trick.
It&rsquo;s her show, sort of. If we did it first, now, she
might be just as bad as ever again, begin all over
again. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Kate said in all truth. Jack&rsquo;s
explanations shed no light whatsoever. His face had
grown steadily redder as he realized that he had
simply made a mess of it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as she stood looking at Jack Denton she
was smiling at herself mentally, to hear how her voice
had taken on the very timbre of Elsie&rsquo;s when she was
being her most unpleasantly polite. What a copy
cat she was. Still, there was a certain satisfaction in
finding herself so successful in a self-made r&ocirc;le. &ldquo;All
you say is just Greek to me. And I ought to be
writing my letter. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned deliberately and sauntered back to her
place in the shade of the orchard. But Jack did not
leave the wall. He stayed there watching her, a
frown gathering on his brow. When she was seated,
with her back against an apple tree trunk and her pad
ready on her knee, he called again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I thought you knew
everything about it all, of course. If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s
a shame. I just can&rsquo;t be apologetic enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>But Kate did not turn to him. &ldquo;Go away, go
away, go away,&rdquo; she said, mentally. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to hear any more. It&rsquo;s not for you to unravel the
mystery. I don&rsquo;t want to know from a stranger. I
feel very indignant. Very, very indignant, and I
hardly know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s silence meant as much to Jack Denton as
the thoughts he could not hear. He turned away
and strolled toward the house, swinging his racket
and looking at the ground dejectedly. Kate was
sorry she had been so deliberately rude, but she
simply could not call him back. She was too really
indignant, and at the same time unable to analyze
her indignation. She returned to her letter.</p>
<p>But she found it very difficult to write. There was
just too much ever to begin to put on paper, in spite
of this being only her third day here! What she
must do was simply tell the <i>facts</i> and let the rest go.
The colour of the facts, all that lay underneath and
over them, must wait. The letter that finally
developed was a thin affair, perfunctory and empty
of interest. Kate had never in her life felt so far
from her mother.</p>
<p>The girls and Miss Frazier selected and cut flowers
in the garden. They took them in loosely on their
arms and tossed them down on a damp sheet spread
on the floor just inside the drawing-room doors.
Then came the deciding on receptacles and the placing
of them. It was all very interesting, and exciting, too,
for as the rooms grew in adornment Kate felt the
party itself drawing nearer and nearer. Miss Frazier
seemed very gay as they worked. She laughed and
said whimsical things in a whimsical manner. And
her every touch was deft, and the result artistic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>That morning Kate learned more about colour values
and proportion than she had ever learned in all her
years of school. She had not dreamed that so much
<i>mind</i> could be used on such an apparently simple
occupation as placing a few nasturtiums in a vase!</p>
<p>What a good time they were having! Kate moved
about the big drawing-room and hall with almost
dancing steps, she was so happy doing her aunt&rsquo;s
intelligent bidding and seeing loveliness form before
her eyes and under her hand. And Elsie was laughing
quite spontaneously at Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s humour
and taking as much delight as Kate in the growing
beauty of the arrangements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone to speak to you on the telephone, Miss
Frazier.&rdquo; Isadora had come out from the telephone
booth under the hall stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, please? Always get the name, Isadora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. I always do when I can. But this
gentleman won&rsquo;t give his name. Says it&rsquo;s not necessary.
He wants to speak to you on important business,
he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t give his name! Nonsense! Tell him,
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But suddenly in the middle of this
command Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s expression changed.
&ldquo;Oh, well, I think I know now who it must be.
That&rsquo;s all right, Isadora.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine dropped the yellow roses she was
sorting&mdash;their wet stems and leaves instantly spreading
white spots on to the polished surface of the little
table. With a quick step she hurried toward the
telephone booth. Kate snatched up the roses and
remedied the harm they had done as well as she
could with her pocket handkerchief. Then she and
Elsie simply stood idly about waiting for the doors
of the telephone booth to open and their Chieftain to
reappear. For having seen Aunt Katherine work
with the flowers they knew themselves incompetent
to go ahead alone.</p>
<p>As Kate leaned against the banister, and Elsie
smoothed her hair before a little gilt mirror on the
wall near the door and secured the shell pins holding
it, the front-door bell suddenly rang and Isadora
came into the hall to answer it. A postman in livery
standing there thrust a pad at her mumbling, &ldquo;Sign
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie dropped a shell pin on to the floor and rushed
to Isadora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special delivery,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was for Elsie. She almost snatched it out
of the postman&rsquo;s hands and scrawled her signature
on the pad that Isadora surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, pushing the pad at the postman
and the next instant shutting the door directly
in his face. Had she shoved him out? Kate was
not at all sure she hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Then Elsie ran through the hall with the letter
hugged up under her chin and up the stairs past
Kate. &ldquo;Tell Aunt Katherine I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo;
she called as she went. But she stopped on the first
landing to lean over the banister and whisper down,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about my having had a special
delivery, will you, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, if you don&rsquo;t want me to. It&rsquo;s
none of my business, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;YOU THIEF!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Kate was dressed and ready for the party half
an hour before dinner that night. She stood
surveying herself in the long door mirror. Anticipation
had brought unusual colour that glowed
even through the tan on her cheeks, and the corners
of her lips were sharply uptilted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cap is certainly a wonder worker,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;It is magic; it makes me pretty. That&rsquo;s
even better than having a cap to make you invisible,
much better!&rdquo; And when she smiled at this idea
the girl in the glass smiled, too, and was fascinatingly
pretty. &ldquo;Oh, if Mother could only see me! She&rsquo;d
hardly believe. If the picture telephone were perfected
and Aunt had one I&rsquo;d spend my last cent to
call Mother up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>All this was not so conceited as it sounds; for
Kate knew perfectly well that ordinarily she could
lay no claim to prettiness, that the charm of the
person clothed in crocus-yellow satin in the mirror
before her was due to Madame Pearl&rsquo;s artistic genius
and the pert, star-pointed silver cap. And when
the idea came to her to go down to the kitchen and
display herself to Julia in this enchantment it was
wholly for Julia&rsquo;s pleasure she intended it; she would
be taking herself down in the same impersonal way
she would take a doll down to turn it round. For
finery of this sort and the kind of glamour that beautiful
clothes give, she did not for a minute associate
with herself, her <i>very</i> self. Ever since Julia had
appeared to her on the stairs, asked eager questions
about her mother and bestowed the gingerbread
man on Kate, she had wanted to see her again. It
seemed so queer and unnatural to be eating the
delicious meals she cooked and ignoring her presence
in the house. Wasn&rsquo;t she a friend of her mother&rsquo;s?
But until this minute Kate had been too shy or
too strange in the ways of her aunt&rsquo;s big smoothly
running establishment to seek Julia out in the
dim, distant servants&rsquo; apartments. Now, however,
in her magic cap, looking and feeling like a young
princess, and also disguised in a way, she had no
hesitation about it. She felt sure that Julia would
be interested and pleased, and that Katherine, if
she were in Kate&rsquo;s place, would do that very thing.
But on second thought she decided to wait until
just after dinner, for this hour would surely be about
the busiest one in a cook&rsquo;s day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>She crossed the room and sat down at her dressing
table again, pulling out a drawer. She would reread
a letter from Sam, a scrawl that had come in
the afternoon&rsquo;s mail when she was too much occupied
to give it her full attention. She had merely glanced
it down hastily and put it away in this drawer on
top of the key to the orchard house. She read it
now, bending her head and not bothering to pick
it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her befool you, Kitty. Take our word,
she&rsquo;s just a silly snob. You&rsquo;re worth millions of her
any minute. What a figure she&rsquo;d cut in that meadow&mdash;you
know, with the King of the Fairies! She
just wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>anything</i>, would she? Teach her
a lesson. We&rsquo;d like to, Lee and I.&rdquo; There was
more of the same sort; but she did not pick it up to
turn the page. There was an uneasy stirring in her
heart. It hadn&rsquo;t been very decent of her, writing
like that about Elsie. She could not remember now
just how she had done it, or why. She knew that
both Sam and Lee must have struggled together over
the composition of this letter in reply. They had
evidently thought it a very important letter indeed,
and spent their best efforts on it. She appreciated
that, and she appreciated their hot partisanship, too.
What she didn&rsquo;t appreciate at this minute was her
own motives in having so called out their sympathy.
And she had better tear it up. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t
a letter meant for other eyes to see. With a strange
little ache in her soul somewhere, probably in her
conscience, she picked up the sheet. Then her heart
stood still, and the fingers crumpling the paper turned
cold. She went queerly sick. The key that should
have lain there under the letter was gone. It was
nowhere in the drawer. And whoever had taken
the key could scarcely have failed to read the words
staring there so blackly up at you, all in Sam&rsquo;s print-like
script!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Moreover&mdash;she saw it now&mdash;the thief had gone
through the whole dressing table before hitting upon
this particular drawer. Everything was a little
out of place. The thief was Elsie, of course. No
one else wanted the key. Well, serve her right, then,
to have read about herself!</p>
<p>Kate tore the letter into shreds and dropped it
back into the drawer. Then she strode through
the bathroom, and stood in Elsie&rsquo;s open door.
Elsie was already decked in her fairy green frock, her
curls tied loosely at her neck in a way that Madame
Pearl had begged her to wear them. But quite regardless
of her finery she was curled up in the window
seat, her sandaled feet tucked under her, looking
dreamily out toward the orchard house. She was
lost in her thoughts for she did not hear or feel Kate
when she came striding across the room to stand
over her. Even in the temper she was in, Kate could
not help thinking, &ldquo;How unconcerned she is about
that beautiful frock! It&rsquo;s as though she was born
in it. How delicate, how <i>fairy</i> she looks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie started out of her reverie at Kate&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my key,&rdquo; she was saying huskily, her
hand held out.</p>
<p>Elsie, in spite of the suddenness of the attack, did
not stir except to turn her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well what key. You stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Red scorched Elsie&rsquo;s cheeks at the word &ldquo;stole.&rdquo;
Kate rejoiced at that. She would make it scorch
even redder. &ldquo;You are no better than a thief, to
hunt through my things, to read my letters. To
steal, to steal, to steal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Kate stormed she knew, deep where
knowing still had a foothold below the surface of her
anger, that her greatest fury was at herself&mdash;fury
that there had been such a letter for Elsie to read
at all, that she had ever written the Hart boys as she
had written them. But in spite of that knowing
she seemed to have no control over the superficial
Kate, the raging, furious Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thief! You&rsquo;re no better than a thief!
Give me back my key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elsie&rsquo;s response to this attack surprised Kate
into a little calmness. She stood up, clenching her
hands, and facing her accuser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I am a thief I am proud of it, proud,
proud. So there! If you think I&rsquo;m ashamed of it
you&rsquo;re wrong! Call me thief all you like. I like
to be called thief. I like it. I am one. I&rsquo;ve got
your old key. I&rsquo;ll give it to you to-night when we
come up to bed, not before. I meant to all along.
Then the orchard house will be yours, all yours.
Go live in it! I won&rsquo;t care. There&rsquo;s the gong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of Kate&rsquo;s growth in calmness her determination
remained. &ldquo;Aunt Katherine gave the
key to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It belongs to me. Give it
back this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I won&rsquo;t, what will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate considered. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go right out
there after dinner and climb in at a window and
explore the whole house. I&rsquo;ll discover your blessed
secret whatever it is and not even wait till morning.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie stood looking at her. But something changed
in her eyes. For a flash, or was it only Kate&rsquo;s wild
imagining, a comrade looked out through those
clouded windows, making them in that instant clear
as day, and then vanished. <i>Now Kate knew what
would have been the expression on the face of the fairy
in the wood that June day, eight years ago, if she had not
flashed back into the sunlight too quickly for her to
catch it. It would have been this sky-clear look of
the golden comrade.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say you&rsquo;ll tell Aunt Katherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked at Elsie, amazed. Such an idea had
never entered her head. Her face said so. <i>Again
the comrade flashed.</i> But it vanished quicker than
before, and this time definitely. &ldquo;Well, you told
your wonderful friends, &lsquo;The boys,&rsquo; on me. You
<i>do</i> tell, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had no answer to that.</p>
<p>Elsie whirled about and went to her bed. From
under her pillow she took the key, and returning,
handed it to Kate, coolly. &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and this is the last time I shall ever ask a favour
of you, Kate Marshall. Please don&rsquo;t use it to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Kate accepted the key. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she promised.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t use it to-night. There won&rsquo;t be time, anyway,
with the party and everything.&rdquo; She was not
speaking to the Elsie who had asked the favour,
however, but to the vanishing comrade, invisible
now, whom she had seen clear enough in that one
flash. Was that comrade within hearing, she wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Elsie said, as though she meant it, and
in a relieved tone. Then she straightened. &ldquo;But
just the same, Kate Marshall, I shall never, never,
never, never forgive you for calling me a thief, not
so long as I live, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were proud of it,&rdquo; Kate rather
cruelly retorted.</p>
<p>Elsie suddenly threw her arm across her eyes.
To Kate&rsquo;s dismay she was sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;The gong
rang minutes ago. Quick, wash your eyes. For
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s sake! She&rsquo;s been so good to us.
Let&rsquo;s go on pretending everything&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masterfully, but very wretched in her heart because
of this bitter weeping of which she was the
cause, Kate hurried Elsie into the bathroom, ran
some cold water into the bowl, and put a wash
cloth into her hands. &ldquo;Quick, wash your eyes.
For Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Kate commanded
again, and Elsie obeyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Then Kate took her hand and hurried with her out
through the twisted passageways to the main front
hall and down the stairs. Dinner had been announced
some time ago, and Aunt Katherine was
waiting, standing and impatient, in the drawing-room.
But when she saw them hurrying and hand-in-hand
she smiled. When you have dressed for
your first real party in your first real party frock
you may be expected to be a little late!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely you are, Aunt Katherine.&rdquo; Elsie
gave her tribute spontaneously in as cool a way
as though the scene upstairs had never taken place;
and Kate echoed &ldquo;Lovely, Aunt Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier was touched. &ldquo;Thank you, my
dears,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I can return the compliment.
In fact, Madame Pearl has outdone herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier deserved their tribute. She was both
handsome and distinguished looking, with her graying
hair done high and topped with a jewelled comb
that sent out shivers of light whenever she moved,
gowned in softest lilac-coloured silk draped with
black lace, and wearing a long black lace scarf in a
most regal manner. The lilac, the green, and the
crocus-yellow figures that passed into the dining-room
arm-in-arm caused the waitress Effie the most
wide-eyed admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they were as friendly, just as friendly as
could be,&rdquo; she told the kitchen when she removed
the service plates. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think Miss Frazier was
their mother, she&rsquo;s that affectionate. Why, it&rsquo;s like
a regular family to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Julia, handing out hot dishes, beamed. &ldquo;Perhaps
everything&rsquo;s coming right, after all,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Katherine&rsquo;s child will shed sunshine all about just
as Katherine did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha, sitting at a distant table playing cards
with Timothy and the gardener, sniffed at that.
&ldquo;Miss Elsie is as capable of shedding sunshine as
anybody,&rdquo; she said, defensively. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just made
of it herself. I&rsquo;m always telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re always telling. But we&rsquo;re never
seeing,&rdquo; Julia retorted. &ldquo;Touched with melancholy,
she seems to me, but as nice as you please. Only
not cheerful to have about. It&rsquo;s probably her poor
mother&rsquo;s awful death. Her heart&rsquo;s broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think her heart&rsquo;s
broken. She&rsquo;s as gay as anything alone with me
sometimes! And she&rsquo;s the most generous child living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does funny things, though,&rdquo; Timothy offered
his bit. &ldquo;Carrying groceries up to her room, buying
eggs and bread and stuff and paying for &rsquo;em herself.
Holt told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha looked at him, unbelieving. &ldquo;Groceries
in her room? No such thing. Who takes care of
her room, do you think? I never saw such a thing
in it. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Timothy related how for a week past Elsie
had bought foodstuffs every time she went to the
village, and refused to give them to him to carry
around to the kitchen afterward. Julia had assured
him they were never ordered by her; so of course
Miss Elsie took them to her room. Where else could
she keep them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Bertha would have nothing to do with that idea.
Indeed, it was impossible there could be any such food
supply as Timothy described in Elsie&rsquo;s room, for
Bertha knew every inch of that dainty apartment,
and kept it in order. Still, she had respect for
Timothy, and could not doubt his word when he
insisted that Elsie actually had bought bread and
eggs, lettuce, oil, and nuts and brought them
home with her in the car. &ldquo;What she does with
&rsquo;em&rsquo;s none of our business, that I can see,&rdquo; she
volunteered. &ldquo;Feeds the birds in the gardens and
orchard perhaps. She&rsquo;s that unselfish! She&rsquo;s probably
even kinder to the birds than to human
beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But every one laughed at this explanation. You
don&rsquo;t feed birds eggs and oil and nuts! No, there
was some mystery about it. Julia had felt mystery
in the air for a week past, and not just because of
Elsie&rsquo;s queer purchases and the puzzle of what became
of them, either. Mystery was simply &ldquo;in the
air.&rdquo; Julia &ldquo;<i>felt</i>&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>Timothy nodded his head knowingly. Timothy
was Irish and very romantic. &ldquo;What can you expect?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;In a house with two young things
like that! Why, they&rsquo;ve just come out of the Fairyland
of their childhood, they&rsquo;re standing now on the
edges of life. What can you expect but mystery?
They&rsquo;re all mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that kind of mystery, Timothy,&rdquo;
Julia protested. &ldquo;I mean regular down-and-out
<i>mystery</i>. I feel it in my bones. You wait and see
if I&rsquo;m not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Effie had returned from the dining-room again.
&ldquo;Miss Frazier&rsquo;s telling them about Rome now,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;She says she&rsquo;ll take them both there together
sometime, if Miss Kate&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;ll let her go. She
said &lsquo;Katherine&rsquo; just as easy as though it didn&rsquo;t
hurt a bit and as though it might be any name.
Perhaps she wouldn&rsquo;t mind our speaking it now.
Things are changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Things were changing with Miss
Frazier. She sat at the head of her table to-night a
light-hearted, spirited person. And she was more
than that. She was intensely interesting. She
said she meant soon to begin to travel, really to travel
and see the world. Arabia attracted her, and all
Asia. A book by a man named Ferdinand Ossendowski
had lately stimulated her roving instincts
and enthralled her imagination. Why should she
not explore a totally different civilization from the
one she had been born into! She recounted some
of Ossendowski&rsquo;s exploits, adventures, and escapes,
and his stories of the &ldquo;King of the World.&rdquo; As she
talked a panorama entirely new to her listeners
unrolled before their minds&rsquo; visions. What a place
this world was, what a place to be alive in, and what
a time to be alive! How the importance of personal
affairs evaporated in the face of such contemplation!
The girls were as stirred as Miss Frazier
herself apparently had been stirred; they were lifted
out of themselves. They felt that the world was a
challenge, that life was a challenge&mdash;a glorious one.
For the time the party, drawing so near now, sank
into insignificance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>But Miss Frazier, looking at their eager faces, suddenly
remembered. She said, &ldquo;Katherine wouldn&rsquo;t
let me take you to such out-of-the-way places yet,
Kate, and of course I wouldn&rsquo;t want to. But when
we go to Rome&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then she had talked about
Rome and places nearer home. But in speaking
of them she touched them with a new light and interest.
Kate&rsquo;s dream, as most girls&rsquo; dreams, had
often been of some day going &ldquo;abroad.&rdquo; Such an
adventure in contemplation had always seemed the
very height of happiness to her. But now, Miss
Frazier&rsquo;s conversation lent travel new glamour, for
Miss Frazier was steeped in history, the history of
nations and religions and art, and her idea of travel
was not simply of adventure into lands, but into
realms of imagination, and into the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you girls like to travel with me for a summer&mdash;perhaps
next summer?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s joy at such a prospect was too great to allow
of words. She simply glowed at Aunt Katherine.
But Elsie suddenly turned away her head. Somehow
then, in that instant, the spell was broken.
The dinner table with the diners floated back to Miss
Frazier&rsquo;s house in Oakdale, Massachusetts, and there
they sat, consuming &ldquo;cottage pudding&rdquo; with lemon
sauce, dressed and ready for a party.</p>
<p>After dinner Miss Frazier settled down, expecting
to finish &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo; before the guests
began to arrive, leaving the girls to amuse themselves
in their own way. Elsie wandered out on to the star-lighted
terrace, looking exactly like a dreamy fairy.
Kate went with her, not speaking, and soon leaving
her, to find her way around to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>The servants in their own attractive dining-room
were just beginning dinner. Kate had forgotten
how many of them there would be, and was almost
overcome with embarrassment, when they all leapt
to their feet and the maids walked around her in a
circle, exclaiming admiringly. &ldquo;I just wanted to
show Julia the new frock Aunt Katherine gave me,&rdquo;
Kate was explaining a little breathlessly. &ldquo;I never
seem to see you, Julia,&rdquo; she added, catching her eye
at last in the group, &ldquo;and I never really thanked you
for the gingerbread man and your kind inquiries
about Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; exclaimed Julia, &ldquo;of my giving you
a gingerbread man! Where were my wits? Why,
you&rsquo;re a young lady. But your mother liked gingerbread
even after she was a young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a fine time at your party in that
gown,&rdquo; Isadora affirmed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t help it.
There&rsquo;ll be nothing half so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Meanwhile Bertha beamed. In a way she felt
responsible for this young vision of splendour.
Hadn&rsquo;t she helped choose the dress, and hadn&rsquo;t she
finally put Kate into it! She was certainly involved
in the display.</p>
<p>Then Julia said, feelingly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all grateful to
you, Miss Kate, for bringing a party to this house
again, for getting things natural. Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
acting like herself now, and it&rsquo;s on account of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t done anything,&rdquo; Kate denied.</p>
<p>But she liked their praise and their warmth, and she
felt now entirely in the mood for the party to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE STRANGER IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>
<p>Soon after eight Miss Frazier stood regally in
the wide hall between her two nieces, receiving
and introducing the first arrivals. They came
fluttering in at the big wide-open door&mdash;girls in
shimmering, fluffy party frocks of rainbow colours;
boys, mostly in white flannels and dark coats, but
a few in tuxedos; and a thin scattering of two older
generations, these latter gray-haired grandmothers
and younger matrons&mdash;some of the mothers looking
scarcely older than their own children, in the modern
manner. All was murmuring, laughter. Then the
orchestra placed back in the blue breakfast-room
began tuning their instruments. Jack Denton
claimed Kate for the first dance. He danced perfectly,
much better than Kate, in fact, who had
had little experience; and all the time he kept up a
stream of interesting nonsense. Kate laughed at
him and swung along more and more in harmony
with the music. How gay, how merry it all was!
Elsie floated past, her green chiffon draperies like
airy wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she lovely!&rdquo; Kate exclaimed in admiration
that must find voice. &ldquo;Do you know I think she
is the very prettiest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She was going to say,
&ldquo;the very prettiest girl I have ever seen,&rdquo; but Jack
interrupted, his brown eyes smiling down at her:
&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s the <i>prettiest</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one in all her life had ever even insinuated
that Kate was pretty before, and the comparison
that Jack indicated now was beyond contemplating.
It was the magic silver cap, of course. Suppose it
should blow off as they danced! How surprised
Jack Denton would be!</p>
<p>As the evening went on Kate entertained more and
more the conceit that she was masquerading in
prettiness. There was no blinking the fact that she
was tremendously popular. And it obviously was
not just the easy popularity of the girl for whom
the party is given. Not a bit of it. It was spontaneous,
joyous. Perhaps she realized the reality
of this popularity all the more because she had never
experienced it before. At the two or three high-school
dances in Middletown which her mother had
allowed her to attend, while not being exactly a wallflower,
she had not particularly shone. There had
been many minutes of suspense when she forced a
semblance of a smile to her lips and intense interest
to her eyes while she watched the more popular
girls swinging by with their partners, while all her
mind was taken up with praying that Jim Walker or
Cecil Quinn would look in from the hall and notice
there was a girl there not dancing. It is true that
Jim or Cecil or some other usually did notice sometime
before the dance was half over and come to
her rescue, for Kate was a good sort and everybody
liked her. At those dances Kate never counted on
the Hart boys for attention, although they were her
escorts to and from; for to them Kate was no better
than a sister. They would have been glad to see
her popular, and taken natural pride to themselves
in it. But it never entered their heads to be gallant
themselves. No, the high-school dances had left
Kate secure in the conviction that she would never be
a success socially and in the philosophical determination
not to care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>But to-night all that was changed. Even Elsie,
perfectly beautiful as she was, was not having the
same success. She danced constantly, of course, but
often with a boy whom Kate had had to refuse.</p>
<p>In an intermission a dowager-like old lady beckoned
to Kate from a chair near an open door leading
out on to the terrace. Kate left Jack Denton who
at the minute was fanning her with a magazine which
he had picked up from a table for the purpose, and
went to the dowager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a chair,&rdquo; the bejewelled one commanded,
&ldquo;and talk to an old woman for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Kate had drawn up a stool that stood
near and sat down close to her she said, &ldquo;You are
every bit as pretty as your mother was, Katherine
Marshall. Every bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate shook her head, laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a disguise,&rdquo;
she affirmed, mysteriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;A disguise? What do you mean, you funny
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cap I am wearing is a magic cap,&rdquo; Kate informed
her, touching its star points ever so lightly
with her finger tips. &ldquo;But shh! don&rsquo;t let them hear.
I will confess to you, though, that it makes me much,
much better looking than I really am, and more
popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening had rather gone to Kate&rsquo;s head. But
the dowager person liked it. She liked it very
much. She tapped Kate&rsquo;s shoulder with her jewelled
lorgnette. &ldquo;Well, then, shall I say,&rdquo; she continued
quite in Kate&rsquo;s fantastic mood, &ldquo;you have your
mother&rsquo;s prettiness to begin with, and on top of that
the magic cap has added a good bit more. But even
better than prettiness you have her spirit. She
was always the belle of every party. And often
I&rsquo;ve sat right here in this very chair and watched
her gliding past with the young men. Dancers
did glide then, not hop and walk. In spite of
her preoccupation she always gave me a smile as
she drifted. And I was old and ugly even then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old and ugly! Are you wearing a magic something
yourself to-night, then? Perhaps it&rsquo;s your
pearls that make you seem stately and lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was blarney in this, for while the dowager
was stately enough she certainly was not lovely in
any usual sense of the word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>But Kate was scarcely responsible. She hardly
knew what she was saying; she was simply effervescing
with high spirits and a heady self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>The dowager laughed mellowly. She was not often
mellow, and certainly she had not been mellow before
this evening. She had sat perfectly still in her
chair, her hands folded, with the expression of a
judge in court. Now, however, she was a judge no
longer. She had slipped into the spirit of the party,
swept in on Kate&rsquo;s fantasy. Miss Frazier watching,
but not appearing to watch, from a distant divan
where she conversed with two or three mothers, saw
the mellowing even at that distance and was well
pleased. &ldquo;Congratulations, Kate,&rdquo; she said, mentally.
&ldquo;Congratulations, and thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dowager was murmuring in Kate&rsquo;s
ear: &ldquo;You are a dear! It&rsquo;s for your mother&rsquo;s and
your grandfather&rsquo;s sake I came to-night and persuaded
my daughter to let the young people come.
And now I am glad I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked up at her. &ldquo;Why for their sake?
Why not come, anyway?&rdquo; But as she spoke automatically,
Kate felt her lips stiffening over the
words. Indignation was suddenly welling up as it
had in the garden with Jack Denton that morning.
Glamour fled away, and Kate was straightening like
a warrior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>But the dowager hardly heard her question, and
certainly did not notice the straightening process.
She went on, &ldquo;I always said no good would come of
it. There&rsquo;s something in good blood that tells&mdash;and
in bad blood, too. Not that we knew the blood
was bad&mdash;although in time it showed it was surely
enough&mdash;just that we didn&rsquo;t know anything about
it! How Miss Frazier dared, a person of her race
and blood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate interrupted with a strained laugh.
&ldquo;Blood!&rdquo; she wanted to exclaim. &ldquo;You make me
creep. Are you Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s grandmother?&rdquo;
But she uttered no sound except the laugh. This
was fortunate for Kate, and remarkable restraint.
She sat with lips stiffened, watching the glamour
gliding away out of her heart, out of the party.</p>
<p>The dowager had paused a minute at Kate&rsquo;s
laugh, waiting for her to speak. But now she continued,
&ldquo;Terrible risk. Everyone warned her. But
she would listen to nobody, not even to me. Now
she&rsquo;s trying to unmake her bed. It&rsquo;s to be hoped
she sees the folly of expecting anything good to be
made out of bad blood. Environment! Pshaw!
Futile!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Kate shivered. She looked around for a way of
escape from this murmuring, croaking person whom
but a minute ago she had dubbed stately and lovely.
If she should start now and dance off on the music
that was beginning again might she outdance the
spectre? Might she overtake the glamour? There
was Elsie, standing alone for the minute in the open
doorway a few steps away. Kate knew now why
she had outdistanced Elsie in popularity to-night;
she knew it as she watched her, hardly aware of
thinking about it at all. Elsie was too fine, too
entirely lovely in the real meaning of the word to
appeal to any but those sensitive to loveliness in its
purest essence. She did not belong to the party at
all. She belonged to the starlight beyond the lamplight,
to the dim orchard&mdash;to the orchard house!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom will you dance this with?&rdquo; the dowager
was inquiring in Kate&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first person that gets here,&rdquo; Kate replied,
quickly. But the dowager did not take offence.
Several were in the race, but a tall, lanky youth won,
a humorous creature with a happy-go-lucky bearing.
When Kate rose to dance off with him, the dowager
took her hand. She smiled up at her in the most
friendly manner. &ldquo;You must come to call on me
soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Or I will call for you and take you
for a drive and then home for tea. That will be
better, I think. How is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Kate managed to smile, but it
was a smile her mother would never have recognized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; her partner informed her the minute they
were out of hearing, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve made a hit. Do you
know who she is? Jack Denton&rsquo;s grandmother,
Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith. The social autocrat of Oakdale.
Everything will come your way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate did not respond to this gay assurance.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; her partner asked, surprised.
Responsiveness had been Kate&rsquo;s greatest charm all
the evening, if she had only known it, not the cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Only I&rsquo;m chilly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The boy whistled. &ldquo;No wonder, having sat next
to that old iceberg so long. Though &rsquo;twas probably
the air from the door, too. It&rsquo;s lots cooler and a
storm is coming up, I think. I&rsquo;d have rescued you
sooner if I&rsquo;d had the nerve. She looked almost
outlandishly amiable, though. What was her line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate shivered, a pretend shiver this time, getting
her gaiety back. &ldquo;Blood! Just blood, if you will
believe me. Is she an ogress as well as a social autocrat?
She discussed blood in several of its phases.
Bad blood, good blood, and talking blood. Like the
singing bone, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed heartily. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t waste
any time in mounting her hobby, I&rsquo;ll say. But she
can&rsquo;t worry you. Your blood&rsquo;s all right. That&rsquo;s
the word&rsquo;s been going &rsquo;round ever since the invitations
were out. &lsquo;Fraziers, one of the best families
in Massachusetts.&rsquo; She was probably congratulating
you and expecting a return of the compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate laughed. But in spite of her new gaiety, the
corners of her mouth had quite lost their winged
tilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>After a few more dances, supper was announced.
Kate had promised Jack Denton early in the evening
that she would take supper with him. She saw him
now looking about for her. In an instant their eyes
would meet and he would hurry across to her where
she stood for the minute alone. But she suddenly
realized that she was tired. She ached with too
much dancing. She would never have acknowledged
this to herself, of course, unless something had gone
wrong with the evening. Hardly knowing why, she
stepped out of the door near which she was for the
instant standing, backward. That step precipitated
her into a different world entirely. The stars had
disappeared behind dark, windy rain clouds. The
air was fresh, and you heard a wind and felt its
edges. Kate took a deep breath. She would stay
here in the blowy dark just for a little. It wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt Jack to search a minute longer.</p>
<p>She moved, still backward, farther away from the
lighted doorway. She brushed against a garden
chair and sat down. She leaned her head against
its high back. An impulse came to take off the
magic silver cap and be herself. Whimsically she
lifted it from her head and placed it on her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just Kate Marshall,&rdquo; she spoke to
herself, but aloud. &ldquo;Just ordinary, plain-as-day
Kate Marshall. Dowagers can&rsquo;t spoil anything for
you. They wouldn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to you
now to bother about spoiling. All the magic that&rsquo;s
really your own, all that isn&rsquo;t false magic, she can&rsquo;t
touch. Nothing she could say could touch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate sighed, having finished her little heartfelt
speech to herself. She felt relieved and freshened.
She had certainly cast off the dowager&rsquo;s spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. All the magic that&rsquo;s your own,
nobody, even a Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith, can touch.
It&rsquo;s safer than the stars from troubling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>That was a low voice speaking directly behind her.
No, it was not simply her own thoughts, although
those words might very well have been in her mind
that minute, for some of them were right out of &ldquo;The
King of the Fairies.&rdquo; But it had been a voice, a
man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Slowly she turned her head. Directly behind her
chair a man was standing. She could not see his
features at all, because the night was so black,
but she thought that he was hatless, and she knew
he was in dark clothes. The wind, not merely its
edges, had come to earth now. Was it flapping the
borders of a long dark cape enveloping the vague
figure?</p>
<p>The vague figure bent down to her. Yes, it was a
dark cape, blowing away from his shoulders on the
wind. It seemed as though the being himself leaned
down out of the wind. &ldquo;Give this to Elsie, please,&rdquo;
he said, in quite a matter-of-fact tone now. Then
the wind took him. At least Kate could not see
him any more. He had stepped back among the
tall lilac bushes that bordered the terrace at that
spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>When he was gone it was just exactly as though he
had never been, except for the folded paper that
Kate found clutched in her hand. That folded
paper, however, definitely fixed him as a reality.
But who could it have been? Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, the detective,
crossed Kate&rsquo;s mind, or one of his assistants,
that young man of the polka-dotted tie. But instantly
she laughed, though silently, at such a notion.
They, neither of them, she felt sure, would by any
chance have quoted from &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo;
while doing business. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer than the stars
from troubling.&rdquo; Had the King of the Fairies
himself passed her there on the wind? No, hardly.
He wouldn&rsquo;t be leaving a note for Elsie.</p>
<p>Anyway, whoever it might be, he had spoken in
a voice whose bidding she was ready to follow.
She rose and took the few steps between the chair
and the drawing-room door. But she stepped over
the sill without hurry, with a meditative air. The
man, standing a little way in among the tall lilac
bushes, said to himself; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the right stuff.
Not startled or upset. Good for Kate Marshall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Denton pounced upon her almost at once.
&ldquo;Where <i>have</i> you been?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The salad I
fought for and won for you has just been commandeered
by my grandmother. Now will you
agree to stay put while I dash into the fray in the
dining-room again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after a minute. First I must find Elsie.
I have to see her very specially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie? Haven&rsquo;t laid eyes on her for some time.
Give me your message and I&rsquo;ll go hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but do look around for her. I will, too, and
that will save time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Elsie was not to be found anywhere in all the
rooms that were lighted and open that evening on
the first floor of the house. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just not down
here at all, unless she&rsquo;s somewhere in the servants&rsquo;
wing,&rdquo; Jack finally reported when they met by
chance at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>Kate now went to her aunt who was having salad
sitting between two dowagers, one of them Kate&rsquo;s
dowager. &ldquo;I am looking for Elsie, Aunt Katherine,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Have you seen her recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier shook her head. &ldquo;Not for some
time. I myself have been wondering what has
become of her.&rdquo; Miss Frazier&rsquo;s dark eyes as she
lifted them to Kate were clouded with worried surmise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith laughed. As a laugh, it
sounded a trifle unsure of itself and uneasy for a
dowager person. &ldquo;I had a few words with the child
myself half an hour or so ago,&rdquo; she volunteered.
&ldquo;Strangely enough, she took some offence at some
remarks that were meant only kindly, and flounced
off. Perhaps she is sulking somewhere about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith, if my niece
was rude to you.&rdquo; But in spite of the words Miss
Frazier&rsquo;s tone was not at all a sorry tone; it was
rather edged. She herself had just been submitted
to some remarks of Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith&rsquo;s that were
doubtless meant kindly, and as a consequence her
sympathy was all with Elsie. But even so, if Elsie
were sulking, she was undoing all that Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
efforts had built up in her behalf. That was a pity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize for the young person you call
your niece,&rdquo; Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith said, suavely.
&ldquo;We will lay it simply at the door of the times.
There is no respect for age, say nothing of <i>birth</i>, in
this generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier paid slight attention to these acid
remarks. She merely said to Kate in a concerned
tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go upstairs to look for her, Kate. Under
no circumstances must the party be ruined for her
by <i>anybody</i>. Do persuade her to come back and
forget any hurts she may have received. Do your
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate flew away on the errand, her heart rejoiced
that her aunt had answered the dowager exactly as
she had.</p>
<p>There was no light in the girls&rsquo; suite. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t
be here,&rdquo; Kate decided. But just to make absolutely
certain she went through and, fumbling for
it, turned on the switch just inside Elsie&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught her eye under the
shaded lights that blossomed forth so obediently at
the pressure of her finger was the fairy green frock
dropped in a heap exactly in the middle of the floor,
the white sandals topping it! Elsie herself was undressed
and in bed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, go away,&rdquo; she commanded, plaintively,
not even looking to see who was in the room.</p>
<p>Kate stood dumbfounded. Then she remembered
her aunt&rsquo;s clouded, kind eyes, and the dowager&rsquo;s
haughty, skeptical nose. She braced herself. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; she said softly, evenly. &ldquo;Not until
you get up and get dressed and come downstairs
with me. How can you treat Aunt Katherine so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get dressed. I won&rsquo;t go down again. I
hate the party! It&rsquo;s your party, anyway. I&rsquo;m not
needed down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was Aunt Katherine right in the theory she had
put forward at the Green Shutter Tea Room? Was
Elsie simply jealous? But Kate rejected that
thought almost before it had presented itself. In
fact, she caught only the tail of it as it switched by!
She spoke reasonably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s my party so-called. But you know
perfectly well that Aunt Katherine means it even
more for you. It&rsquo;s so that you&rsquo;ll get to be friendly
with all the girls and boys who you say hardly speak
to you. My being here was just an opportunity.
Now if you vanish in the very middle of things,
how do you think that will help any of us? It will
be just unspeakable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be unspeakable. Go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps you do. You are, anyway. But
do you want Aunt Katherine to be ashamed? Could
you ever forgive yourself for treating her so? She
knows Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith has been rude to you,
and she herself just now has come very near being
rude to Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith on your account.
Whatever all the fuss is about&mdash;honestly and truly
I haven&rsquo;t an idea what it is about myself&mdash;Aunt
Katherine is all for you, Elsie. She&rsquo;s your champion.
You can&rsquo;t go back on her now, right before
everyone. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re having
a good time, not a bit. If you&rsquo;re any good at all
you&rsquo;ll get dressed in a jiffy and go back down with
me. You can <i>pretend</i> you&rsquo;re having a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Kate finished. Her argument had exhausted her
strangely. She found herself trembling with the
intenseness of her conviction that Aunt Katherine
must be saved from all embarrassment.</p>
<p>For a few minutes Elsie made no visible response
to the harangue but lay perfectly still, her eyes shut,
her head turned away. Kate stood in the middle of
the room, the fairy green dress at her feet, waiting.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done all I can,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
just see whether she has any sense at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a space of utter stillness Elsie stirred, threw
back the coverlet, and sat up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I
suppose,&rdquo; she said, sulkily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a pig, that&rsquo;s
all. I was only thinking of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not look at Kate but busied herself picking
up her scattered clothes. When Kate started to
leave the room, however, she called her back. &ldquo;Do
you mind helping me with these?&rdquo; she asked almost
humbly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ring for Bertha. Do
you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Let&rsquo;s hurry. Everybody&rsquo;ll be
wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now when Kate&rsquo;s hands were needed she was
recalled to the note still clutched in her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I entirely forgot,&rdquo; she exclaimed, dismayed.
&ldquo;Here is a note for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Elsie unfolded the paper. If she had looked
miserable before, when she had finished reading the
few words on that paper she looked tragic. &ldquo;Who
gave it to you? How did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was amazed at the way petulance had turned
to sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who, or even exactly how,&rdquo; she
confessed. &ldquo;I was alone for a second on the terrace.
A man appeared just out of the wind in a blowing,
long cape. He had a singing voice at first so
I hardly knew whether he was real. And he quoted
&lsquo;The King of the Fairies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded. Nothing in Kate&rsquo;s account surprised
her apparently. The girls did not speak to
each other again but silently worked together repairing
the damage done to Elsie&rsquo;s hair-dressing,
getting her into the fairy green dress, and finally
bathing away evidences of tears. Supper was just
about over downstairs before they were ready to
descend, and dance strains sounding. Jack had not
given Kate up, however, but was faithfully waiting
for her on the stairs.</p>
<p>He saw the girls the minute they appeared at the
upper turning, and bounded up several steps to meet
them. &ldquo;Where have you been hiding?&rdquo; he asked,
laughingly, and without any signs of surprise whatever.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve managed to save some salad for you
both and ices, too, here in the window seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a window seat on the stairs, halfway down
the first flight. &ldquo;Oh, thanks,&rdquo; Kate said, heartily.
&ldquo;Have you had some yourself, though?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly likely, not until you came. Didn&rsquo;t you
promise to have supper with me?&rdquo; Jack looked
feigned surprise and grief.</p>
<p>He was certainly making their return to society
easier. Girls and boys glanced up at them rather
curiously as they danced past the drawing-room door,
and a few of the mothers, sitting where they had a view
of the stairs and the landing, rather stared. But since
the truants could laugh and talk with Jack, who was
acting as though their absence had been in no way
extraordinary, they had no time to be self-conscious.</p>
<p>But suddenly Jack&rsquo;s face went queer right in the
middle of some nonsense. It was half a laugh,
half dismay that twisted his countenance. Quick
as thought, he pointed up to the second turn of the
stairs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine old clock!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Take me up and show it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why they obeyed his command so docilely&mdash;put
their plates down again on the window seat and went
back up the stairs&mdash;they hardly knew. But they
did go, like lambs. And when they had turned a
corner and were out of sight of dancers and chaperons
Jack stopped, not looking at the clock at all,
and dropped his eyes to Elsie&rsquo;s feet. Even Elsie
laughed when she saw what he was calling attention
to. In their hurry the girls had forgotten one item,
and here was Elsie ready to appear in the drawing-room
in her pink satin, swansdown-edged boudoir
slippers. They were very dainty slippers, quite
fetching in fact, but they were hardly in harmony
with the fairy green frock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Run back and change while Kate and I admire
the clock,&rdquo; Jack advised. And Elsie ran.</p>
<p>When she returned the three sat on the window seat
and ate their long-delayed supper. At first Elsie
said she wasn&rsquo;t hungry and couldn&rsquo;t possibly eat,
but Jack laughed her out of that. Soon Rose came
up to join them, carrying her ice, and stopping to
take dainty tastes as she came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the nicest situation of all,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
settling down beside Elsie. &ldquo;And what a view it
offers. Why, it&rsquo;s like being in a box at the theatre.
We saw you and Kate, by the way, at &lsquo;The Blue
Bird.&rsquo; We thought it very grand of you to have a
whole box to yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others followed Rose, some of them with plates
of ice cream. And Kate noticed that the ices and
the ice cream were in every case in a stage of melting.
She suspected then that Jack had overheard the
conversation about the missing Elsie and had collected
this little band, encouraging them to <i>eat slowly</i>.
The realization of his tact and consideration
wiped out for ever any lurking indignation toward him
left over from the morning, when he had squirmed at
the idea of her calling Elsie down to play tennis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>A few minutes later, when Miss Frazier came out
into the hall with old Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith who was
leaving and seemed to require her escort, she saw to
her great surprise and relief that the very merriest
part of the party was on the stairs. There were
eight or nine girls and boys crowded about Kate and
Elsie talking eagerly and interrupting themselves
with the lightest-hearted laughter. No need to
worry any more now because her girls were not on
the floor dancing. This was an even better way of
getting acquainted. Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith, feeling
for an instant that she had lost the full attention
of her hostess, followed her gaze upward. Kate
was looking down, and their eyes met. Then old
Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith did an amazing thing. At
least, the few people who observed it were amazed.
She made the motion of &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; with her lips
to Kate, and <i>blew her a kiss</i>.</p>
<p>Both her grandchildren stared round-eyed. &ldquo;I
say,&rdquo; Jack whispered, &ldquo;you have certainly charmed
my grandmother. What did you ever do to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Kate, wonderingly respectful, with
frankest curiosity.</p>
<p>When Miss Frazier returned from seeing the old
lady out of the door, she stood for a minute within
hearing of the conversation on the stairs. They
were discussing &ldquo;The Blue Bird&rdquo; now, but presently
it changed to &ldquo;The King of the Fairies,&rdquo; a book they
all had read, apparently. She smiled inwardly,
well pleased. &ldquo;Katherine over again,&rdquo; she told
herself. But she had to admit, too, that Elsie was
doing her share in keeping the subject at a high-water-mark
of intelligent conversation. &ldquo;Kate is certainly
having an influence,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;an even
finer influence than I could have hoped for.&rdquo; Then
she passed on into the drawing-room, trailing her
black scarf more regally than ever since she was so
honestly proud of both her nieces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>When the last guest had departed Miss Frazier
took an arm of each niece and led them toward the
stairs. &ldquo;It was all a great success,&rdquo; she affirmed.
&ldquo;And it was you girls, yourselves, who made it a
success. Kate, you were what a new girl&mdash;at least,
any new girl worth her salt&mdash;ought to be, the belle of
the ball. And, Elsie, you did me more than credit. I
am, oh, so very proud of both my girls. Old maiden
aunt that I am, I felt that I had two lovely daughters.
Now I advise you to dash to bed and save all discussion
of the party until morning. Breakfast is ordered
for half-past nine to-morrow, so that you may sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we help you close up?&rdquo; Elsie offered.
&ldquo;I heard you tell Isadora to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, my dear. I am going to stay down
here awhile, finishing &lsquo;The King of the Fairies.&rsquo; I
was almost at the last chapter when Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith
led the procession of arrivals. It is an enchanting
story, just as you said. Now, good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all its finality the &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; was spoken
with greatest affection. In the last few hours Aunt
Katherine had flowered into a serenely warm human
being. Both Kate and Elsie realized the change in
her, and each, for a different reason, was disturbed
by it; Kate because now less than ever she understood
how her mother ever could have let such a
lovely person go out of her life; and Elsie&mdash;well,
that concerns the secret of the orchard house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KATE ON GUARD</span></h2>
<p>Kate was waked by the flapping of her window
draperies. The rain that had held off during
the evening was upon them now, a wild, windy, heavy
rain, unusual for July. Kate heard it spattering on
the floor of the balcony and pattering on the floor inside
the tall windows. This last would never do.
Much as she liked the fresh wet wind, full of garden
and damp earth smells, she must close those windows
or the room would be damaged. It was pitchy
dark, and Kate could be guided only by sound and
the direction from which the wind blew. Somehow
she got the big door windows closed and fastened,
simply by the sense of touch, and then turned gratefully
bedward. But she did not go back to bed that
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s door had blown shut to only a crack, and
light was coming through that crack. That was
perhaps none of Kate&rsquo;s business, but instantly she
was concerned. She and Elsie had not said &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;
to each other, but parted in silence. And
Kate had gone to sleep wondering just how much
Elsie was truly hurt by whatever it was that old
Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith had said to her, and wanting,
but lacking the courage, to go in and sit on the edge
of her bed to talk it out and comfort her if she
could. If she had heard Elsie so much as turn in
bed she would have taken heart; but not a sound had
come from the other room after the light was out.
In the end Kate had gone to sleep still undecided
as to what she ought to do.</p>
<p>Now the light drew her. Perhaps Elsie had not
been to sleep at all. Perhaps she was too unhappy
to sleep. Kate had no idea what time it was, and
she did not think of the time. Her only anxiety
was that Elsie might not be angry with her for
trying to comfort. On bare feet she crossed the
bathroom floor and pushed at the door.</p>
<p>The lamp by Elsie&rsquo;s bed was burning, but she had
placed her party frock over it to dull its glow, so
the room was in a queer green light. That was
what Kate noticed first. The bed was empty. But
Kate found Elsie at once, her back turned to her, and
still unconscious of her presence, at the farther end
of the room bending over a suitcase which she was
busy packing. Elsie was fully dressed, even to her
hat. She was wearing the green silk of their Boston
jaunt, and the same brown straw hat. It was perfectly
plain that she was running away, running away
in the middle of a black, stormy night.</p>
<p>Kate pushed the door all the way open. &ldquo;What
are you doing?&rdquo; she whispered, loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Elsie turned upon her. She had been crying as she
packed, and even in the excitement of the moment
Kate reflected how oddly tears and a set, tragic
face went with the jaunty costume with its brave
flutter of orange at the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong in bed,&rdquo; Elsie whispered back.
&ldquo;And any one can see what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Running away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, running away. And no business of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warrior in Kate straightened. This was a
clear call to arms. She felt very old and wise.
She certainly would never let that crying little girl
go away like this into the rain and dark night. She
couldn&rsquo;t expect to walk out right under Kate&rsquo;s nose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what the note I brought you was about?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Was it a plan for this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was telling me <i>not</i> to do this. But I&rsquo;m
going to, just the same. He didn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie returned to her packing. Kate moved nearer
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to stand here and <i>let</i>
you run away right in the middle of the night like
this?&rdquo; she asked, curiously.</p>
<p>Elsie did not glance up at her. She simply said,
&ldquo;Well, what can you do to stop me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake the house, of course. Call Aunt Katherine.
Shout for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie stared at Kate in unfeigned surprise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
tell on me?&rdquo; she asked in an unbelieving tone. &ldquo;I
thought you weren&rsquo;t like that. I thought you were
decent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am decent. I don&rsquo;t tell, not about little things,
like the key. But this is entirely different. I should
certainly wake the whole house if you tried to walk
out with that suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Elsie lifted the suitcase which
was filled and closed now, and picking up her hand-bag
from where it lay on the dressing table, took a
step toward the door. But Kate reached it ahead
of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shout,&rdquo; Kate warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate Marshall, please, please, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie began to cry silently and stood with her
suitcase in one hand, her bag in the other, and her
face turned from Kate, ashamed of her tears. Kate&rsquo;s
heart softened, but not her determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get undressed and into bed, and promise you
won&rsquo;t get out again to-night, or I shall go right to
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s room now and tell her,&rdquo; Kate
said firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>After a moment of hesitation Elsie began to pull
off her clothes furiously. In about two minutes she
was in bed, her face turned toward the wall. In
silence Kate picked up the cast-off garments Elsie
had scattered, and put them away. The green suit
she hung up on a hanger in the closet and the hat
she put away in the deep hat-drawer. Then the
suitcase claimed her attention. Bertha had better
not find it packed and standing by the door in the
morning. Kate unlatched it and took out the
things. &ldquo;The King of the Fairies&rdquo; lay at the bottom
of them all, with a little New Testament.
Kate put the two books on Elsie&rsquo;s bedside table under
the lamp. Still Elsie did not move or speak; she
might have been asleep for any sign she made that
she knew what was occupying Kate in the room.</p>
<p>But Kate spoke to her: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve burned a hole
in your party dress,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was true. The heat from the electric bulb had
been strong enough to scorch the flimsy material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; Elsie muttered from her pillow.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never wear it again, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not taken the trouble even to look at the
damage. That told Kate, if it still needed telling,
how truly desperate Elsie was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into my room,&rdquo; Kate announced, after
she had hung the ruined party dress away. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to bed, for I&rsquo;m not. I shall
be sitting up, wide awake, and surely hear you if
you get up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie did not answer.</p>
<p>Kate did not mind that. If never before, now she
certainly merited Elsie&rsquo;s wrath. Elsie had hated her
before without any cause. There was a certain comfort
to Kate in knowing the cause of her present
state of mind, a certain satisfaction in no longer
being scorned for nothing, but for something. She
could defend herself to herself now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>But could she defend herself adequately? Had
she really any business to have so interfered with
Elsie&rsquo;s plans? Had she any reason so at a leap to
have become a dyed-in-the-wool tattletale, at least
to have threatened tattletaling? Yes, she thought
she could excuse herself. She thought she was more
than justified. Even so it was a hateful business.</p>
<p>Kate wrapped herself in her dressing gown and
sat in a wicker chair by her reading light. She
did not dare lie in bed to think for fear she would
drop off to sleep. She gave herself up to pondering
the situation, but kept an ear cocked all the while for
the slightest movement in the other room.</p>
<p>What should she do about things in the morning?
Even if Elsie had failed to get off to-night, if Aunt
Katherine were left unwarned, she would certainly
plan so as not to fail the next time. Why, to-morrow
morning itself Elsie might walk out of the
house and never come back. If Elsie had any place
to go to, Kate would not be so worried. But she
knew that Elsie&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s family, what there was
of it, was living in Europe, and that not one member
of it had ever shown the least consciousness of Elsie&rsquo;s
existence. Aunt Katherine had told her about that
and marvelled at it. So Elsie had just no one to take
her in if she did run away. There was the stranger
in the garden! But he had told her not to run away.
Kate was sure Elsie had spoken truth about that note.
Who <i>was</i> the stranger in the garden? His note had
turned Elsie tragic, whoever he was.</p>
<p>There was no way out of it that Kate could see but
telling. Elsie must be protected against herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>But half an hour&rsquo;s more pondering brought Kate
to the conclusion that she would not tell <i>Aunt
Katherine</i>. Her whole instinct was against that.
Aunt Katherine, charming as she was, and kind, was
after all only an aunt, and an aunt who had said
herself that she simply could not like Elsie. What
Elsie needed was a <i>mother</i>. This was work for
Katherine. Kate had perfect confidence that if
her mother could talk with Elsie everything would
come clear for everybody. Light suddenly dawned
in Kate&rsquo;s puzzled mind. Katherine might take
Elsie home with her. They would all three go back
to Ashland together, and there all would be made
right for Elsie. Once with Katherine&rsquo;s arms around
her shoulders, and Katherine&rsquo;s gentle, understanding
eyes looking into hers, Elsie would confide. Kate
never doubted for an instant that her mother would
be overjoyed to take the beautiful, unhappy Elsie to
her heart. Why, since Aunt Katherine had failed
so to make her happy, and since she did not even
like this foster-niece, it might become a permanent
arrangement; Elsie would live with them. She
would be a sister!</p>
<p>All this was rather wild dreaming. Kate straightened
mentally and pulled herself back to hard facts.
The facts were simply that Kate could not bring herself
to the idea of delivering Elsie up to Aunt Katherine for
judgment or help, either one. Elsie needed a mother
more than she needed anything else in the world.
Katherine was a mother. Katherine must come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>And only a few hours ago Kate had felt very far
away from her mother, very independent of her!
She smiled now, remembering. Well, she had never
needed her more. Sitting alone here in the sleeping
house, with rain and wind at the windows and
Elsie lying hating her in the next room, Kate <i>ached</i> for
her mother.</p>
<p>She decided to write her a special delivery letter.
That would bring her day after to-morrow, or day
after to-day rather, for it must be getting toward
day now. For one day Kate could stand guard
over Elsie. She was glad of her decision to write
as soon as she arrived at it. It seemed automatically
to relieve her from grave responsibility. Besides,
the composition of the letter would keep her awake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so, mother darling, please come on the very first train.
<span class="jr">Your desperate <span class="sc">Kate</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It had been a long, full letter. She had told
Katherine just everything that had to do with Elsie
and her strange behaviour from their very first meeting.
When Kate looked up from her signature she
found the night had passed; dawn was in the room,
at least the gray light of a rainy morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Kate rose, stretched her cramped limbs, and
yawned prodigiously. Then she crept to Elsie&rsquo;s
door. Elsie was not asleep. Their eyes met.
There were dark circles under Elsie&rsquo;s eyes, and her
face in the gray light was almost paper-white. The
girls stared at each other silently. Then Elsie turned
her head away on the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How she hates me!&rdquo; Kate thought, as she stole
back through the bathroom. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dreadful
hater. I couldn&rsquo;t hate any one that way, no matter
what they had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned out the light that was still burning by
her bed. Then she took a cold shower bath and
dressed in a fresh dress, the second chintz curtain
one. She brushed her hair vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some difference,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;between the
party Kate and the morning-after one. Too bad I
haven&rsquo;t a magic cap for day-times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps she needed one especially to-day. For
tired, sleepless people are rarely pretty people; and
Kate&rsquo;s eyes were almost as dark-rimmed as Elsie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Her toilet completed, she stole again to Elsie&rsquo;s
door. Again their eyes met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you I&rsquo;d go to sleep,&rdquo; Kate whispered.
Elsie&rsquo;s pallor bothered her. But Elsie did not deign
to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Kate, back in her room, with over four hours before
breakfast stretching away ahead of her, curled
up on the foot of the bed with &ldquo;The King of the
Fairies&rdquo; in her hands. She opened it just anywhere,
much as one opens conversation with a friend
just anywhere. It is the <i>presence</i> you want. And
the presence of the soul in this book did not fail
her now. How it drove walls backward and pushed
roofs skyward! And as for out-of-doors, it made
that boundless, lifting veils and veils of air disclosing
Fairyland or Paradise, in any case the realler
than real.</p>
<p>Kate was withdrawing from the chintz-curtained
Kate on the bed. She was rising up out of that
drowsy figure. She was floating. But the flowers
from the chintz were still decking her, only they
were living flowers now, smelling all the sweeter for
the rain soaking their petals. And the birds from
the chintz were with her, too, changed to living
birds, soaring, floating, drifting with her, singing
shrilly in the rain. The mysterious, many-coloured
portals of sleep were opening to her far off beyond
the last lifted veil of air.</p>
<p>It was nine-fifteen before she woke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ONE END OF THE STRING</span></h2>
<p>Breakfast was served in the little blue-and-white
breakfast-room. A fire burned there cheerfully
in the grate, making it possible to leave the doors
open on to the rain-beaten terrace. The storms of the
night had subsided into a steady, hard downpour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a day!&rdquo; Miss Frazier exclaimed when she
appeared.</p>
<p>Kate had come into the room just ahead of her.
Moved by an impulse of affection she went to her
aunt and kissed her on the cheek. &ldquo;Thank you for
that beautiful party,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was gorgeous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier was pleased. &ldquo;Thank you, my dear,
for paying back so, in being happy about it, the little
that is done for you. &lsquo;It is more blessed to give than
to receive&rsquo; may be, but the art of receiving graciously
is a rare and beautiful accomplishment. I
hope Elsie&rsquo;s experience with Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith
didn&rsquo;t entirely keep the evening from being &lsquo;gorgeous&rsquo;
for her, too. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dressing, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Miss Frazier was summoned to
the telephone. &ldquo;The same gentleman who wouldn&rsquo;t
give his name yesterday,&rdquo; Isadora informed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me, Kate. I&rsquo;m not having grapefruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Aunt Katherine returned it was plain to
see that she was greatly stirred, though trying hard
to be calm and matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to go to town,&rdquo; she told Kate.
&ldquo;And I shall be gone all day, probably until rather
late to-night. In spite of the rain I think I had
better take the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Elsie came in. She sat down languidly at
the breakfast table and leaned her cheek on her
hand. Everything that Effie offered she refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to have any breakfast at all?&rdquo;
Miss Frazier asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I thought I could eat. But when I see
things I know I can&rsquo;t. I think I&rsquo;ll be excused if I
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frazier looked at her keenly. &ldquo;I am afraid
you are ill. Come, let me feel your forehead. Yes,
it is hot. You have a temperature almost certainly.
And the shadows under your eyes! Is this what a
party does to you? What a pity that I must leave
for Boston at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to the maid Effie. &ldquo;Effie, tell Bertha
to get Doctor Hanscom on the telephone and ask
him to come over here before office hours. Then she
is to help Elsie back to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bed! Oh, no. Please! Please, Aunt Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Bed isn&rsquo;t so terrible as all that!
You may read or knit, until Doctor Hanscom arrives
and gives other orders, anyway. Kate will sit with
you so that you won&rsquo;t be lonely. Yes, indeed, you
must go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie was very much distressed at this turn of
affairs. Kate saw dismay in her face, and she easily
guessed the reason. Of course, being tucked up in
bed and getting the attention and care of an invalid
would make running away to-day almost impossible.
But there was no question of Miss Frazier&rsquo;s being
obeyed. She expected obedience and she got it.</p>
<p>When Elsie had left the room Miss Frazier forced
herself to take up conversation lightly and naturally
for the remainder of the meal, but Kate did not fail
to notice that her fingers shook slightly as she lifted
her toast and that her dark eyes were unusually
bright. Evidently the &ldquo;gentleman who will not
give his name&rdquo; had had some news of importance.
Kate felt confident that that gentleman was the
detective, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finished your book last night,&rdquo; Miss Frazier
was saying. &ldquo;I understand your enthusiasm. It
is literature and much more. The author must have
deep and even esoteric wisdom. One wonders very
much who and what he is, the author. But whoever
he is, even if this book is all he has to show, he is a
great man. Has it occurred to you, Kate, how much,
how extraordinarily, like your mother, Hazel, the
girl in the story, is? It might be a direct portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Kate laughed. &ldquo;Oh, have you discovered that,
too? Even Mother had to admit it&mdash;that in looks,
anyway, Hazel was exactly herself when she was
that age. But I say she is still like Hazel, old as
she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-six isn&rsquo;t exactly aged, you know. One
might very well keep some remnants of looks even
until then.&rdquo; Aunt Katherine was smiling. &ldquo;But
it is a strange coincidence how a person of the imagination
can so echo a person in life. I was fairly
startled last night when I realized how vivid the
resemblance was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though Kate heard and replied to all her
aunt&rsquo;s remarks during that breakfast, her mind was
most of the time on other matters, and if Miss
Frazier could have known, Kate under her calm exterior
was hiding a heart as perturbed as her own.</p>
<p>Kate was glad when Miss Frazier rose. She assured
her that she was very well able to amuse herself
at home this rainy day, and that she would do
everything for Elsie that she could. Yes, she would
see to it that she stayed in bed! Yes, she would
read to her, if Elsie felt like listening. Yes, Aunt
Katherine was not to worry. And so Miss Frazier
departed, and Kate was left virtually in charge of
the house, the responsibility for things quite hers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Of course, Kate knew perfectly well that Elsie
would not want her to sit with her, no need even to
ask about that. And Kate must hurry to send her
telegram. Beyond the portals of sleep she had decided,
or possibly it had been decided for her, that
the special delivery letter would not make things
happen quickly enough. Katherine must be wired
for. She was needed to-day. Kate had waked with
this determination full-blown. But how could she
risk leaving the house now to send the wire, with
Elsie in the desperate mood that was so obvious?
How could Kate be sure that Bertha would not help
Elsie to run away in her absence? Bertha adored
Elsie, and Kate herself had reason to know that
when Elsie pleaded it was easier to do her wish than
not. She realized, of course, that a telegram may be
given over the telephone; but her inexperience and
shyness made her doubt her ability in such a complicated
procedure. Besides, the bill would be charged
to Aunt Katherine in that case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall just have to chance it,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;Elsie needn&rsquo;t know I am out of the house at all,
and I can hurry.&rdquo; She would run up to her room
and get her cape and hat as quietly as possible.
She would have to slip down into the kitchen then
and borrow an umbrella from Julia.</p>
<p>But Bertha, administering to Elsie, heard the door
of Kate&rsquo;s closet when a surprising little gust of wind
banged it shut while Kate was inside reaching for
her hat. When Kate had fumbled for the knob and
opened the door, Bertha had come into her room.
At once Kate noticed that Bertha, too, was labouring
under great excitement. Her cheeks were on fire
and she was simply quivering with suppressed emotion
of some sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Kate,&rdquo; she cried, nervously, looking at
the hat in Kate&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, no help for it now. Elsie had heard, of
course. But Kate was much bothered. &ldquo;Yes, on
an errand. I&rsquo;ll be gone almost no time at all,
though.&rdquo; This she spoke loudly, meaning that Elsie
should not miss it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you are really going into the village
<i>could</i> you do an errand for Miss Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ho, ho! Was this the thin ruse Elsie meant to
use, to get her out of the way?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Kate said, noncommittally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fixes everything nicely then.&rdquo; Bertha took
a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;I would go myself but Miss
Frazier expects me to see the doctor when he comes,
in order to report to her. And then there is all my
work. Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha hurried back into Elsie&rsquo;s room and Kate
heard a low murmuring between them. When she
returned she had Elsie&rsquo;s purse in her hand. &ldquo;Here
is some money. Miss Elsie says to use only that
that&rsquo;s tied in the handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So! Elsie was letting her pocketbook go. Last
night, Kate remembered, Elsie had taken it when
starting toward the door. And running away she
would surely need it. Kate recalled her first motion
to decline the purse and tuck the handkerchief with
the coin tied in its corner into her own. With Elsie&rsquo;s
pocketbook in her possession, Elsie was just so much
the safer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does she want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen eggs. A head of lettuce. Some
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stared. Bertha stared back at her, nervously.
But Kate restrained any exclamations and
simply nodded. When Bertha realized that she was
not going to be questioned, relief like sunshine overspread
her flushed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you be as quick as possible?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Again Kate was pleasantly surprised. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll
be as quick as I can,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;If Elsie will
promise to stay in bed until luncheon time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha looked at her in genuine astonishment at
that. &ldquo;But of course. Miss Frazier has ordered
that she spend the day in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she must promise me herself. You tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie had heard. She called out now, &ldquo;Yes, I
promise. And do please hurry, Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was deeply relieved. Now she could absent
herself from the house without fear of finding Elsie
flown when she returned. &ldquo;And whatever you do,
Kate Marshall, and whatever they say about it,
don&rsquo;t let them charge those things at the store to
Aunt Katherine,&rdquo; Elsie called again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t an umbrella,&rdquo; Bertha said, bringing
her Elsie&rsquo;s, a gay green silk one with an ivory handle.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wild day for July, and I&rsquo;m not at all certain
Miss Frazier would like your going out like this.
If you could only have the car&mdash;but it&rsquo;s gone to town
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. And you needn&rsquo;t feel responsible.
I have an errand on my own account, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate did wonder much about Elsie&rsquo;s errand.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wild-goose chase Aunt
Katherine is on in town, and those detectives, too.
Where they <i>might</i> do some good, and find some <i>clues</i>,
is right here. Who was that man in the garden?
Why all this buying of groceries? If there is a snarl
of some sort that needs unravelling, and if Elsie has
anything to do with it, the end of the string is right
here. But how do I know the snarl ought to be unravelled
by detectives&mdash;that it&rsquo;s any of their business?
Oh, heavens! I must run to the telegraph office.
Mother is terribly needed this very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Western Union Station she did not study
long over the wording of her message. Time was too
precious, she felt, for even a minute&rsquo;s delay, if Katherine
was to catch the noon train from Middletown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mix-up here come first train nobody sick or dead <span class="sc">Kate</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was aware that those ten words would worry
her mother unspeakably. But how, in the limits of
a telegram (Kate had never conceived of the possibility
of a telegram being over ten words in length!),
was she to persuade her mother to take the next
train if she was not to be worried? No, the only way
to make absolutely sure of her coming was to frighten
her into it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>The man who took the message looked at Kate
curiously. He knew perfectly well who Kate was
and wondered very much about the &ldquo;mix-up.&rdquo; He
thought Kate peculiarly self-contained for a young
lady who found herself in a situation that necessitated
that message. If he had only known, however,
Kate&rsquo;s calm exterior was entirely assumed.
She was more excited, perhaps, than she had ever
been in her life before, and full of presentiments of
even greater excitement to come. Sending the wire,
though, was a great relief. In a few minutes Katherine
herself, &rsquo;way off in quiet Ashland, would be concerned
in the affair. With Katherine once &ldquo;in it&rdquo;,
Kate was assured things must somehow turn out
right.</p>
<p>Now for those puzzling groceries.</p>
<p>When she came out of Holt and Holt&rsquo;s with her
purchases, Jack Denton suddenly appeared at her
shoulder. He was without an umbrella, but in a raincoat
and felt hat that required none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I walk along with you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Kate was very glad to see him. His high spirits
brought relief from the strain and confusion in her
mind. Gallantly, and with the air of courtesy that
was so delightful in him, he took her bundles from
her and then her umbrella. With laughter and exchange
of party remembrances they started off together
through the rain toward home.</p>
<p>But before they had gone half the distance Jack
turned serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at our dinner last night
(Mother gave a dinner before your dance) some of us
decided to go on strike, to stand up for our own ideas
more practically against our elders. Younger generation
stuff. We all used to like Elsie tremendously,
and now we are going to treat her just exactly as
though nothing had happened, if she&rsquo;ll let us. I
think she will, too. She was all right last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate turned to look up at Jack under the umbrella.
The brown eyes that returned her look had lost their
easy laughter and were earnest with the glow of a
<i>cause</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granny&rsquo;s had her way long enough,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Our mothers and fathers never really cared a
bit, you know. It&rsquo;s just those more ancient ones.
They barely survived the shock. You see <i>their</i>
daughters and sons had been playing around with
him, and any one of their daughters might have
married him. Granny says her grandson (meaning
me) is going to have the protection her daughter
didn&rsquo;t have (meaning Mother). It&rsquo;s really just a joke.
And we only humoured &rsquo;em because they were so
rabid. Now we&rsquo;re sorry we were so soft. I wanted
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Kate said, quickly. &ldquo;Not
one word. Can&rsquo;t you explain better? What happened
that was so awful? What was the thing that shocked
them so? And what has it to do with Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Until this minute she had not wanted such information,
when it came, to come from outside. She
had felt that to learn that way would be disloyal of
her. But now that her whole mind was turned to
helping Elsie she wanted to know all she could. She
wanted to get hold of the end of the tangle, any way,
and perhaps then there would be some chance of
straightening it out. The information that Jack
was apparently able to give her would surely constitute
that end; once having that in her fingers she
might unravel snarl after snarl for herself.</p>
<p>Jack, however, was not prepared for her questions.
He whistled, startled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what the
fuss has been about?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
about anything? I thought you were only pretending
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, truly. Not a thing. Aunt Katherine was
surprised that I didn&rsquo;t know, too. But she wouldn&rsquo;t
tell me. You tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair. I thought, of course,
you knew. But you did know there was something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, almost the first minute I got here. Elsie
acted so queerly. And then she said she hardly knew
you. And all the time there you were living right
next door. It was puzzling. Now tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they want you to live in ignorance it&rsquo;s
hardly up to me to enlighten you, is it?&rdquo; Jack was
very ill at ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother would have told me if I had
let her. And Elsie herself acts as though I knew.
She has accused me several times. I&rsquo;ve wired to
my mother to come. I am frightened about Elsie.
She is in danger of doing&mdash;oh, something that would
be dreadful for Aunt Katherine, and for herself, too.
Aunt Katherine is away for the day. The more I
know the more I can help. Please tell me just
everything you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate doing that. But if it helps you to help&mdash;&mdash; Anyway,
it&rsquo;s only fair to you. You ought to know
what everybody else knows. Elsie&rsquo;s father, Nick
Frazier, is a thief. He stole some securities, or something,
from Miss Frazier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did not even exclaim. She had slowed her
steps for the great revelation and was now gazing
straight ahead. It took some seconds for her to react
at all to what Jack had said.</p>
<p>Jack paced on beside her, protecting her from the
gusty rain by dexterous manipulations of the green
silk umbrella.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough in itself to make
them so rabid, though,&rdquo; he went on, worriedly.
&ldquo;You see they blame your aunt some. She adopted
him, you know&mdash;anyway, let him call her &lsquo;aunt&rsquo;&mdash;and
took him into her home and prepared him herself
for Harvard. He wasn&rsquo;t even in school. He was
working in some mill in spite of being just a kid,
fourteen or something like that, when she discovered
him. He hadn&rsquo;t any family&mdash;didn&rsquo;t even know who
his family were, had been brought up in some institution
or other. Well, Miss Frazier treated him just
as though he belonged to her, gave him her name and
everything. This is all an old story in this village.
Rose and I were brought up on it. Then when he
was in college Miss Frazier expected him to be asked
everywhere to holiday affairs here, and she gave
parties in her house. She acted just as though he
were a Frazier really. The young people liked him,
though it seems he was something of a diamond in
the rough, you know, &rsquo;spite of Harvard and all.
But the parents grumbled. That was our grandmothers,
you see. They only let it go on because
your aunt was a Frazier and could do almost anything,
they being such a fine old New England family.
The parents always said no good would come of it,
though. &lsquo;Blood would tell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Kate agreed, tremulously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what your grandmother said last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Still mumbling over that? Talk about
fixed ideas! When he stole those securities&mdash;he did
it while your aunt was abroad or somewhere&mdash;and
she let him go to prison for it, everybody said, &lsquo;Now
Katherine Frazier&rsquo;s learned her lesson, I guess.&rsquo;
That was two years ago or more. But then right
away his wife died, and Elsie came to live here with
Miss Frazier, and Miss Frazier expected us all to
treat her just as we always had when she visited before,
just as though she <i>were</i> Miss Frazier&rsquo;s regular
niece and not the daughter of a convict who doesn&rsquo;t
even know his own name. That got the old folks&rsquo;
goat right enough. They said they&rsquo;d tried that once
on their own children. But would they let it be perpetrated
on their grandchildren? You can bet, no.
And there was a great to-do. And, well, we haven&rsquo;t
been exactly cordial to Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Kate said nothing when he stopped. Jack wondered
what she was thinking. He felt very hot and
ashamed. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all past now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Elsie isn&rsquo;t to blame. Why should she suffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut until she speaks,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<p>But Kate did not break the silence until they came
to the foot of the steps leading up to Miss Frazier&rsquo;s
front door. Then she looked up at Jack as she took
her bundles from him. &ldquo;Thanks for telling me
everything like that,&rdquo; she said, gravely. &ldquo;I think
it&rsquo;s all pretty hard on Aunt Katherine and just simply
awful for Elsie. No wonder she thought I was a
beast. Why, I called her a &lsquo;thief&rsquo; herself, and said
we were being followed by that detective as though
we were thieves. Now I understand a lot of things!
I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;just <i>wallowed</i> in <i>breaks</i>. I hope my
mother gets here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you play Mah Jong?&rdquo; Jack asked quickly.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you and Elsie come over to play this
afternoon? There&rsquo;s nothing much we can do out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s sick in bed, so I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t. Thank
you for carrying the things&mdash;and for everything.&rdquo;
In spite of her perturbation she flashed her peculiar
Chinese smile when Jack raised his hat. What nice
manners he had!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Jack himself, walking slowly back to his own door,
was obviously deep in thought. But in the midst of
worrying over the ethics of what he had done in going
into all that unpleasant business with Kate, he suddenly
thought, &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t nearly so pretty as
last night. But it&rsquo;s awfully jolly when she smiles,
and I guess when she isn&rsquo;t being pestered with sickening
scandal and such stuff she smiles a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">INTO THE ORCHARD HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>Isadora opened the door for Kate as she came up
the steps. There was a yellow envelope in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram for you, Miss Kate. It came just
a minute ago. Oh, I do hope there&rsquo;s no bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate caught a glimpse of Julia wavering at the
farthest end of the hall in shadow, and there was
Effie just inside the drawing-room, deliberately
watching while she opened the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not bad news,&rdquo; Kate informed these
anxious friends of her mother&rsquo;s as she tore open the
end of the envelope. &ldquo;I <i>expected</i> a wire.&rdquo; She
felt some importance in saying that, and she was
glad to clear the air, for it was charged with keenest
apprehension.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s message had gone and Katherine&rsquo;s reply
arrived all within an hour. Katherine had certainly
not hesitated over a decision. Kate nodded as she
read and smiled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Am autoing to Ludlow Junction to catch back way express
Oakdale five-five whatever situation keep cool and brave in a
few hours Mother will be with you rejoiced you&rsquo;re not sick. K.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Katherine certainly had not counted the words!</p>
<p>When Kate looked up, the anxious watchers had
vanished, dispersed by her smile as she read. She
sat down in a chair standing against the wall. Her
arms dropped at her sides and she leaned her head
against the high-carved back of the chair, crushing a
little her mother&rsquo;s best hat. For the minute she was
too absorbed in her own thoughts and too fatigued&mdash;the
fatigue that is apt to come with sudden complete
relief of mind&mdash;to remember such an item as a hat.</p>
<p>A step on the stair made her look up. Bertha was
hurrying down, rustling in a raincoat, a scarf tied
over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I saw you coming,
from a window upstairs. Are these the things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate nodded, and Bertha took the packages and
pocketbook from the floor where Kate had carelessly
dropped them to tear open her telegram. Bearing
them carefully she went away <i>through the drawing-room</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t get to the kitchen that way,&rdquo;
Kate mused, hardly caring. &ldquo;And why the raincoat?
Oh, well, What&rsquo;s the use of trying to puzzle
anything out any more? Mother&rsquo;s coming, Mother&rsquo;s
coming, Mother&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>After a little while, yawning and half asleep, she
wandered into Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s own sitting-room&mdash;a
graceful, comfortable little retreat tucked away in
an isolated corner of the big house. The outstanding
feature there was an oil painting of Kate&rsquo;s
mother at the age of sixteen in a blue party frock
standing against dark velvet porti&egrave;res. It was a
painting by Hopkinson in his earlier manner, executed
with finish and most delicate feeling. The painting
was one of Miss Frazier&rsquo;s most valuable possessions,
and Kate had surmised, when her aunt had shown it
to her, one of the dearest. Certainly it was a painting
with a spell over it, a spell of beauty and something
besides, unnamable and illusive. Perhaps it
was the spirit of youth which the artist had with
such genius caught there, that gave it its magic.</p>
<p>Kate unfolded an afghan that lay conveniently on
the foot of the sofa beneath the portrait, and curling
herself up under it, settled down for a nap. She felt
perfectly safe in losing herself for the time because
Elsie had given her promise to stay in bed until
luncheon.</p>
<p>But at one o&rsquo;clock Bertha brought down the news
that the doctor had ordered Elsie to remain in bed
all afternoon, too. She was asleep now, and Bertha
thought she would sleep for several hours. Her temperature
had gone down to normal and she was comfortable.
Later, when she woke, Bertha would take
her up a light meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Lunching alone for Kate was a rather dreary procedure
in spite of the coziness of the breakfast-room
where Miss Frazier had thoughtfully ordered the meal
served, and the merry little fire crackling on the
hearth. Kate had had a good sleep and she was now
so rested in body and mind that she could think about
things with some clarity. She leaned her elbow on
the table and her chin in her hand and regarded the
fire as though it were her companion at the meal.</p>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s father was a thief! How would it feel to
have your father a thief and in prison and everybody
knowing it? Kate had never known a father, so she
found it difficult to put herself in Elsie&rsquo;s place. But
suppose it were her mother? Oh, supposing that was
too painful, and certainly it wasn&rsquo;t like that for Elsie.
Perhaps Elsie cared as little for her father as she had
for her mother. (Kate had never recovered from
the horrid shock of that disclosure.) She certainly
never mentioned him. But she was not allowed to
mention him. What had Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s letter
said on that point? &ldquo;Nick&rsquo;s name is not mentioned
here, either by Elsie or the servants,&rdquo;&mdash;something
like that. But imagine consenting to forget your
father for <i>any one</i>! No, of course Elsie had no such
devotion for her father as Kate&rsquo;s for her mother.
Not likely. No use to try to compare, then. Besides,
the mere notion was altogether too painful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning, though. Why had
Elsie bought bread and eggs and lettuce and nuts
which she surely had no use for herself; and why
had she been so urgent that Kate should buy more
to-day? Surely she didn&rsquo;t expect to take such perishable
things with her in her flight from Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s
house! There had been no sign of eatables
when Kate unpacked the runaway&rsquo;s suitcase last
night. Oh! An idea! Had Elsie planned to run
away only as far as the orchard house, and was the
food supply stored there? Was that the mystery
about the orchard house? Had she discovered a
secret room or something and was planning to live in
it like a hermit without any one&rsquo;s knowing? Kate
built up quite a plot around that idea. It would be
exciting and fascinating to live right under your
guardian&rsquo;s nose while that guardian was scouring the
country for you. But in spite of the possibilities of
this story-like mystery, Kate finally let it go as an
explanation. It was too far-fetched.</p>
<p>A better solution! Had Nick, her father, escaped
from prison? Elsie was shielding him, perhaps.
Why, of course, she was hiding him in the orchard
house. Kate&rsquo;s heart began to hammer. Stupid,
not to have thought of that at once, just the minute
Jack told her about Elsie&rsquo;s father being a thief. All
the food had been for him. The book she couldn&rsquo;t
afford to buy, too! She had wanted it for him.
How very simple it all was! And they were going to
escape together. They would escape into Canada
or somewhere. No, vague memories of something
called &ldquo;extradition papers&rdquo; came to mind. They
would simply hide themselves in the crowds of some
big city. They would vanish. Oh, well, from the
very first Elsie had been a vanishing comrade.
When she ran away with her father she would vanish
for good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>Now, how did the detective work into this solution
of the puzzle? Suddenly there was a snag. If Nick
had escaped from prison, wouldn&rsquo;t state detectives
be on his trail? Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, Aunt Katherine had
told her, was a private detective. And if Nick had
really escaped from prison surely Aunt Katherine
would not in any way be concerned in finding him.
That would be simply a matter for the police.</p>
<p>Kate turned her eyes uneasily to the open door,
almost expecting to see a plain-clothes man spying
upon her from the rain out there. But there was
only the drenched garden and beyond, the orchard,
wreathed in a haze of wet weather.</p>
<p>One more snag: surely if Nick had escaped from
prison it would have got into the papers, and someone
in Oakdale have seen it. Then Jack would know,
and he had not even hinted at such a thing.</p>
<p>But now for the most important consideration of
all: the stranger in the garden who had given her the
note for Elsie last night? Who was he, and where did
he come in? The reasonable answer was that he was
Nick himself, Elsie&rsquo;s father, the thief, the man who
had stolen from his own benefactress. But Kate
did not harbour this idea for the fraction of a second.
That voice was not the voice of such a one, and such a
one would hardly be quoting from &ldquo;The King of the
Fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Deep down in her heart, deep beyond reason, Kate
had connected that stranger in the garden with what
Elsie had said about fairies in the orchard house.
This man himself, who had given her the note, was a
human being, of course, She didn&rsquo;t go so far as to
think him unearthly; but he might very well know
about those fairies who &ldquo;were in it somehow.&rdquo; He
seemed a person who would indeed be <i>likely</i> to know.
Kate was ready to connect that stranger with any
mystery so long as it was a pleasant mystery. With
an unpleasant mystery&mdash;never. His note had told
Elsie not to run away; Elsie herself had said so.
But he had known that she meant to run away.
That was apparent. Where had he come from out
of the wind last night?</p>
<p>What of that light she had seen in the orchard
house her first night here? Those three open windows?
That closing door in the second story&mdash;closing
as though a knob had been turned?</p>
<p>Oh, there were just too many things to think of and
to fit in. The shortest cut to clearing up some of the
mystery and giving her mother a starting point to
work from with Elsie when she should get here at five
o&rsquo;clock to-night was to explore the orchard house
now, right away. There was her heart whacking at
her sides again! Yes, but she must do it, escaped
convict or not. That was the first step to be taken.
She had the end of the string&mdash;Jack Denton had
given her that&mdash;the orchard house came next, made
the first knot to be untangled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no dessert, thank you.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t eat
with your heart hammering like that, could you?
She walked to the door. The rain was stopping, had
almost entirely stopped. The key was upstairs,
back in the drawer of her dressing table where she
had replaced it after wringing it from Elsie yesterday.
If she went for it now Elsie might hear and again
weep her into a promise to keep away from the orchard
house. The key had been only a matter of form,
anyway. There were always the windows. Kate
was sure they couldn&rsquo;t all be locked. She would try
getting in that way before she bothered about the key.</p>
<p>She glanced down at her rubber-soled canvas ties.
No need for rubbers. No need for a sweater or
umbrella, either: the little showers of rain blowing
down from trees and bushes would do her chintz no
harm.</p>
<p>She crossed the terrace, hoping neither Elsie nor
Bertha was looking from a window overhead, and
walked through the orchard straight to the orchard
house. Before trying the windows, better try the
door. That was only common sense. The latch
lifted under her fingers! Had the house always stood
open like this, and all that fuss about the key! She
pushed the door softly open and went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to do with fairies,&rdquo; Elsie had said.
Kate remembered the words as she crossed the threshold.
And she felt surely as though it might easily
have something to do with fairies; she might have
been stepping into Fairyland itself for the eerie sensation
that crossing the threshold gave her.</p>
<p>She left the door open behind her, and a gusty wet
wind followed her like a companion. It filled the
hall with the pungent scent of the syringa bush by
the step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>There was nothing in the hall but a little oblong
table standing against the wall at the foot of the stairs,
a table with curly legs and a carved top on which
stood an empty card tray, and hung above the table
was a narrow long mirror in a gilded frame.</p>
<p>Kate looked into the mirror. How many, many
times it had reflected her mother&rsquo;s face. How very
unlike Katherine her daughter was, hair bobbed so
straight, rather slanting narrow eyes, full lips,
freckles across the nose! Kate surveyed this image
with her usual slight sense of annoyance upon meeting
it in a mirror. She imagined Katherine, a
Katherine of her own age, looking over her shoulder
in the glass, their two heads together. It was the
Katherine of the portrait, dark curly head, wide
misty eyes, olive cheeks ever so delicately touched
with rose.</p>
<p>Oh! Had that face actually gleamed out there
for an instant? Her mental vision had been so clear
that she could not be sure it had not, just for a flash,
taken actual form.</p>
<p>Well, if the Katherine of sixteen years ago had
joined her now and was going to accompany her in
her exploration of the orchard house, so much the
better. Kate had always longed for a girl comrade
more than for anything else in the world. Come,
let&rsquo;s pretend she had one at last, Katherine at fifteen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>First the parlour. It opened on the right. The
door stuck. Kate pushed with her knee and lifted
up on the knob simultaneously. It opened explosively.
And a door up in the second story somewhere
opened in sympathy with it. Kate stood very
still, listening. The jarring of the walls was the cause,
of course; but even with this explanation accepted,
it was creepy.</p>
<p>The little parlour was stuffy, as all closed rooms are
stuffy. But almost at once the syringa-scented air
from the open front door had remedied that; it was
so much more vital than the smell of dust and mildew.
But why think of the parlour as &ldquo;little,&rdquo; for by any
ordinary standards it was certainly a good-sized room.
Only in comparison with Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s spacious
drawing-room did Kate feel it now small and quaint.</p>
<p>The furniture was much as it had been left when
Grandfather Frazier died and the house was closed.
But the books were gone from the low bookcases that
lined the walls. Those Aunt Katherine had sent to
her niece, and Kate had grown up in their company.</p>
<p>The bookcases, a Franklin stove with a worn low
bench in front of it, a big square library table between
the windows, some oil paintings on the walls (Kate
guessed some of these to be Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s work),
a comfortable-looking but very unfashionable chintz-covered
sofa, and several very shabby, very welcoming
easy chairs with deep seats and wide arms and
curving backs&mdash;that was the parlour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>And the fifteen-year-old Katherine Frazier had
gone in ahead of Kate. She was moving about the
room, poking up the fire (the fire that didn&rsquo;t exist)
in the grate, throwing her school books on the sofa,
reading absorbedly curled up with her feet under her
in the deepest chair by the window, making toast at
the coals in the grate while the blue teapot kept itself
warm on the stove&rsquo;s top. Katherine had told
Kate about this room, how she loved it and what she
did in it. Her father was there usually in the picture,
too, and often Aunt Katherine. But somehow Kate
imagined neither of them now.</p>
<p>What a merry, comfortable, <i>spirited</i> room it was.
Its spirit had been created by that dark-eyed girl.
And the smell of the syringa! Now Kate knew why
her mother could never get by the syringa bush at
the corner of Professor Hart&rsquo;s lawn without stopping
for deep breaths when the syringa was in flower.</p>
<p>The dining-room was across the hall. The dining
table was long and narrow, the handicraft of Great-grandfather
Frazier. It was curly maple and mirror-like
with the polishings of many years. Close at
one end two chairs were drawn up to it. Several
more stood with their backs against the wall. Did
Grandfather Frazier and Katherine sit close together
like that at the end of the long table those years they
lived alone? Kate wondered. Yes, she was sure
they did; for there was the Katherine of her imagination
pouring tea for her father and handing it to
him with a sweet, affectionate smile. No need for
Nora to come in from the kitchen to pass it. This
father and daughter could reach each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>The kitchen failed to hold Kate&rsquo;s attention. She
missed Katherine there. The young Katherine had
not liked housework. Indeed, it was still a burden
to her, however gracefully she carried the burden.
Perhaps that was why Kate could not find her in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>If stepping across the threshold into this empty
house had stirred Kate&rsquo;s imagination and made her
feel the possibility of fairies hiding somewhere in the
apparent emptiness, going up the stairs stirred it
even more.</p>
<p>It was a steep, rather narrow, little staircase,
painted black and with the wooden treads deeply
worn by generations of feet. And right in the very
middle of her ascent, on the seventh stair, to be
precise, there happened to her a thing that had sometimes
happened before but never quite so <i>definitely</i>.
She thought and felt that she had done this all before,
that she had come up these stairs on exactly the errand
she was on now; she remembered herself on this
identical stair, with her hand on this identical portion
of the railing. More than that she knew exactly
what was going to happen to her when she reached the
top&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t she know when she had experienced
it all before?</p>
<p>But even as she felt this and in fact knew it, her
foot had left that seventh stair and the memory had
vanished. Now she only had a memory of a memory,
or to be exact not even that. She only remembered
that she <i>had</i> remembered. The instant itself,
the connection, was lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>She looked into the guest-room first. It was a
pretty room in spite of the absence of curtains and
bedding. The furniture was painted a creamy yellow.
Katherine had painted it a few days before her
marriage. By the window there was a dainty little
writing table with pens and blotters and even ink-bottle
conveniently placed. But the ink had been
long evaporated and the pens were rusty. Above
the bed there hung, passe-partouted in white, a
flower-wreathed quotation. Had Aunt Katherine
or her mother painted the flowers and illuminated
the letters? The flowers were morning-glories, very
realistically done, and the quotation from &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning-glories are incongruous with the words,&rdquo;
Kate mused, smiling. She felt more sophisticated
than the fifteen-year-old Katherine who had admired
this crude bit of art enough to hang it in the
guest-room, who perhaps was even herself its perpetrator.
&ldquo;Yes, morning-glories are incongruous with
the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Are they. Why?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Kate answered, aloud.
She remembered her flight that very morning toward
the slowly opening many-coloured portals of sleep.
Morning-glories might very well be growing on
Sleep&rsquo;s walls.</p>
<p>But whom had she answered? Who had spoken?
No one, of course. There was no one there <i>to</i>
speak, except Kate herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>On either side the hall there was another bedroom.
Kate merely looked in at their doors. One
had been her mother&rsquo;s, and it was entirely bare now,
for all the furniture had gone to the barn-house in
Ashland years ago. The other had been Grandfather
Frazier&rsquo;s room, and somehow Kate felt that
she did not want to pry there. It would be like getting
acquainted with him when his back was turned.</p>
<p>Now there remained only the &ldquo;playroom&rdquo; and
the upstairs &ldquo;study&rdquo;&mdash;a long room at the back of the
house, the room where the windows had stood open
that first night of Kate&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;and ever since, for
all she knew. From her very first entrance into the
house Kate had been <i>listening</i> toward this room. It
was in that room she fully expected to discover Elsie&rsquo;s
secret. It was really the goal of her pilgrimage
through the house. But the nearer she drew to it
physically the more she drew back mentally. She
was not exactly frightened. What did not frighten
Elsie need not frighten her. It was simply uneasiness
in the face of mystery.</p>
<p>There was the playroom between, though. Kate
was grateful to pause a minute in the playroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>The playroom was down a step, through a little
low door. Kate had to bend her head to go through
the door. It was the smallest room she had ever
been in, about the size of a goodly closet. Shelves
were built in all around the walls, leaving space only
for the one little low window that reached the floor.
Before the shelves, strung on brass rings to brass
rods, hung dusty, faded calico curtains, yellow
flowers on a blue background. Kate pushed back
a curtain, jangling all its rings. The shelves held a
jumble of toys, birds, beasts, carts, engines, and on
the top shelf a row of dolls, some broken almost beyond
recognition as dolls, but two or three still
healthy bisque beauties smiling blandly over her
head at the opposite wall.</p>
<p>There were three lilliputian chairs in the room,
one a black rocker painted on the back and seat with
flowers and fruit. In one corner there was a huge
box of blocks, wooden building blocks that Great-grandfather
Frazier had made for Grandfather
Frazier when he was a little boy.</p>
<p>Kate knelt by that box, and idly began constructing
a house. She had always adored building with
blocks when she was a little girl, and now the old
fascination seized her; besides, she was putting off
the minute when she would open the door of that last
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>But as she completed the second wall of the house
she turned suddenly and looked over her shoulder.
Had she heard something? A rustling, like a dress
coming down the hall and pausing at the door of the
playroom? Whom did she expect to see bending
down at the low door and looking in at her where
she sat on the floor building with blocks like a little
girl? Strangely, it was not the sixteen-year-old
Katherine she had been imagining as her companion
whom she pictured stooping down at that door to
look in. It was Katherine&rsquo;s mother, Kate&rsquo;s grandmother,
who had died when Katherine was still a little
girl playing with blocks. Only she would not look
like an ordinary grandmother, of course. For she
had died when she was only twenty-four. She was
a young woman, very graceful, very gentle, lovely.</p>
<p>Of course she wasn&rsquo;t really there at the door, wondering
who had come in her baby&rsquo;s stead to play in
the playroom. Of course she wasn&rsquo;t there with a
spray of syringa flower at her belt. It was just Kate&rsquo;s
vivid imagination. She was sensible enough to know
that. The rustling of her dress had been the leaves of
the drenched apple tree boughs against the window
pane tossed by a rainy breeze. And the syringa
scent had followed Kate up here and even down into
the little playroom.</p>
<p>It was a low little room, so low that Kate could but
just stand up straight in it. And it was entirely bare
except for the shelves with their treasure trove of
toys, the box of blocks, and the lilliputian chairs.
But for all that the room was alive to Kate now. It
was almost giddy with life. And it was a life that
did not concern her. She was an intruder. She became
uneasy as intruders are uneasy.</p>
<p>But she was not driven away precipitately. She
stayed long enough to replace the blocks in their
place coolly. Then, still coolly, she stood up and
went out of the playroom, closing the door softly
after her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>In the hall, however, she allowed herself to hurry.
The door to the last room, the study, was ajar. Had
the figure of Kate&rsquo;s imagination gone on ahead to
that room&mdash;the young mother? For an instant Kate
hesitated with her fingers on the knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psha! What are you afraid of! Silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Downstairs, the hall door, which she had left open,
blew shut with a bang, A fresh downpour of rain
rattled on the shingles just above her head. (There
was no attic above this part of the house.) Kate&rsquo;s
impulse was to run down and secure at least the
staying open of the front door, so that she might have
an unimpeded exit in case of panic. The door
fastened open, she would come back and have the fun
of discovering for herself Elsie&rsquo;s secret which was
the mystery of the orchard house.</p>
<p>But Kate did not follow her impulse. Instead,
she squared her shoulders, lifted her head a little defiantly,
and pushed back that last door. She stepped
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; But it was not a shriek. It was
just a soft &ldquo;oh! oh!&rdquo; of purest astonishment. For
the room was occupied; but not by the ghost of her
grandmother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAST ROOM</span></h2>
<p>A man was sitting leaning forward over a table
with his back to the three windows, his face
toward the door. His arms were spread out on
the table, his hands clasped. He leaned there
waiting for something. It was Kate for whom he
had been waiting, for he had heard every movement
of hers almost since her first light step on the
porch.</p>
<p>Kate stood now, smiling at him across the room.
Her sudden smile following upon her amazed &ldquo;Oh!
Oh!&rdquo; surprised him almost as much as his being
there at all surprised her. He was prepared for her
being startled, angry, accusing, anything except
charmed. On the tip of his tongue there waited a
reassuring word. That was why he had not risen
when she entered; he wanted to avoid any movement
that might frighten her. But all his careful precaution
was wasted. Kate was not frightened. She
was charmed, purely and simply charmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are the boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the boy
in the dragony, flowery picture frame!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>But even as she spoke she realized that although
it was the boy indeed, it was the boy grown older.
The crisp curly hair was clipped very short and was
almost entirely gray. And there were deep lines
about his eyes and nose and mouth. The light in the
face had grown, too, that peculiar light betokening
gaiety of the spirit and sympathy. Yes, it was truly
the boy, only the boy <i>more so</i>, in spite of lines and
gray hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dragony, flowery picture frame?&rdquo; he repeated
after her in the voice of the stranger in the
garden.</p>
<p>He had spoken. He was real. Not just another
one of her fancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the top drawer of Mother&rsquo;s desk. That
boy. Only excuse me, I thought I was talking to a
dream. Are you real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed, a very jolly laugh, and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mother know you would be here? Is that
why she insisted that I come into the orchard house
the first minute I could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No, she couldn&rsquo;t know I
would be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up then. But as he moved Kate noticed
that he took special care to stand between the windows
where he could not be seen by any one who
might be in the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made a mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think I can be the person you think. My picture
wouldn&rsquo;t be in your mother&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate nodded, perfectly sure of her facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are. Mother&rsquo;s always had you.
You&rsquo;ve been our talisman for years, both of ours.
And that&rsquo;s funny, for neither of us knew about the
other&rsquo;s feeling until just before I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face had reddened. &ldquo;Her talisman?&rdquo; he
asked, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as much hers as mine. It was very funny.
But it&rsquo;s even funnier&mdash;of course I don&rsquo;t mean funny,
I mean strange&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve found you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know who I am?&rdquo; the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that you&rsquo;re the talisman. I don&rsquo;t know
your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Your mother didn&rsquo;t want you even to
know his name. Well, time justified her. It fulfilled
all their prophecies. He was a nobody first
and a convict afterward. No wonder she didn&rsquo;t tell
you his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked at him steadily, trying to take it in,
to connect it up. He went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother didn&rsquo;t tell you his name because it
is the same as hers. She is too ashamed. I am Nick
Frazier. Now you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words sounded bitter, but the man&rsquo;s manner
belied them. He said it all with a friendly smile,
seeming more concerned that Kate should get
things straight and not be too shocked than airing
personal bitterness. But Kate protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. She did you some wrong once. That
is why she couldn&rsquo;t talk about you to me. But she
did say that she knew it would come right sometime.
She wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it. So I mustn&rsquo;t. But
you know it isn&rsquo;t at all as you say. She isn&rsquo;t ashamed
of you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a minute&rsquo;s thought she added, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
that boy, and you are, then she didn&rsquo;t know anything
about&mdash;about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Jack Denton told me that this morning.
Well, I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t know that. And now I
remember she said she had no idea why you and
Aunt Katherine had quarrelled. She was puzzled
by that in the letter asking me to come. She didn&rsquo;t
even know Elsie was living here. She didn&rsquo;t know
anything about you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Kate.&rdquo; Nick spoke rapidly. &ldquo;Tell your
mother when you go back all that Jack Denton told
you. But tell her, too, that it isn&rsquo;t so black, not quite
so black as it sounds. And tell her that all the King
of the Fairies taught those two kids in the orchard
I have learned since I went to prison. For I wrote
&lsquo;The King of the Fairies.&rsquo; I wrote it in prison,
thinking everything over. Tell her I shall never
again accept another penny from any one or let any
one help me. What I took from your aunt I&rsquo;m paying
back to-day with the royalties on the book. Will
you remember to tell her that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate nodded. Yes, certainly she would remember.
But her whole mind was taken up with delight that
he, the boy in the dragony, flowery picture frame,
was the author of their precious book. That was
what mattered most, in this minute, to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>He saw that she was not impressed with the fact
of his having been a convict. That he was her talisman
come alive, and the author of &ldquo;The King of the
Fairies,&rdquo; both at once, was tremendous enough to
wipe out all the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s father wrote &lsquo;The King of the Fairies,&rsquo;
that book! And she never told me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate sat on the edge of the table and bombarded
him with questions. He answered them all. There
were places that had puzzled even her mother in the
book. He clarified them for Kate now. &ldquo;My new
book is <i>clearer</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am learning better how
to say what I want to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your new book! There is another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will be published this fall.&rdquo; He told her
about that. She was enthralled. She clasped her
hands and listened, the corners of her mouth tilting
up like wings.</p>
<p>Then it was her turn to talk. Nick was the sort of
person who draws you out. In all her life Kate had
never experienced such sympathy in a human being.
That was Nick&rsquo;s rare gift. She told him the story
of her life, quite literally, at least, from the year she
was seven, beginning with the day of her sharpest
memory when she and her mother saw the fairy by the
spring. It was very much on her mind now because
of that experience at Madame Pearl&rsquo;s and she told it
all to Nick in detail. &ldquo;How can it be explained?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;How could Elsie be just exactly that
fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard question,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But if
there&rsquo;s anything in what these fourth dimensional
experts are saying&mdash;then it might be explained reasonably
enough, even mathematically. You know
they say time <i>is</i> the fourth dimension. Well, in
that instant in the woods, they might say, you got
somehow into a four-dimension world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate did not understand. Nick came from his
station between the windows and sat on the edge
of the table beside her, forgetting the hypothetical
somebody in the orchard, and went into the subject
more deeply. Kate followed his reasoning for a time,
almost as though she were beginning to grasp something
of the meaning of it all, when, bang! She
slipped back to her first position of ignorance. She
didn&rsquo;t understand a bit.</p>
<p>Nick laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly the same with me,&rdquo;
he confessed. &ldquo;I get a little farther than you do now
in grasping it perhaps, and then &lsquo;bang!&rsquo; just as you
say, I lose the steps by which I got there. However,
we can know that science itself is working toward
some such explanation for that fairy by the spring of
yours and its like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you don&rsquo;t believe in fairies at all? I was
really only looking into the future, at Elsie as she would
be years away, in that mirror of Madame Pearl&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. Just because we have reason to believe
that what you saw wasn&rsquo;t a fairy&mdash;since it
was Elsie and couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;proves no case against
the existence of fairies. Does it? Yes, I believe in
fairies right enough, but that&rsquo;s a matter of faith with
me rather than reasonable conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all very fascinating. Nick led Kate&rsquo;s mind
a race, and she felt as though she were &ldquo;expanding.&rdquo;
She called it &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; when telling her mother
of it later. Why, Nick did to you exactly what his
book did, pushed roofs skyward and walls horizon-ward.
And all the while he was so jolly. He laughed
and made you laugh often, laughter with a special
quality of joy in it.</p>
<p>But suddenly, right in the midst of everything, he
looked at his watch. &ldquo;Do you know, it&rsquo;s after
five,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate interrupted what he was about to say.
&ldquo;After five! Why, Mother may be here already!
I forgot about time! How could I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother? Here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I telegraphed her to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had quite forgotten her anxieties about Elsie,
and how much she had imagined her in need of Katherine&rsquo;s
sympathy and help. Now everything came
back with a rush. &ldquo;I must run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nick caught at her hand before she could run.
&ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; he said, excitedly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
me?&rdquo; Then he became calm, but still held Kate back
by the hand. He spoke very earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her out here. Your aunt isn&rsquo;t at home.
No one need know. I must see her. Will you bring
her? Tell her it may be our very last chance to meet
ever. Tell her that and <i>make</i> her come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Kate looked into the face so suddenly become passionately
earnest and said in surprise, &ldquo;But of course
she will want to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she sped through the orchard it occurred to
her that she had solved nothing, got nowhere, or
almost nowhere, in the mystery. What was Nick
doing in the orchard house? Was he a fugitive from
the law? Somehow, though she had begun to wonder
again, she was not a bit bothered. Nick was
Nick. Who wanted more?</p>
<p>Katherine had arrived in a taxi from the station a
few minutes earlier and presented herself anxiously
at Miss Frazier&rsquo;s door. She had no trepidations
about meeting her aunt now, no thought of their
standing quarrel. Her whole mind was taken up
with her daughter. To say that she was worried
would be to describe her state of mind weakly. She
was very nearly frantic. She had read and reread
Kate&rsquo;s telegram on an average of once every five
minutes since its arrival, and in spite of all this study
was no nearer guessing at the nature of the &ldquo;mix-up&rdquo;
than she had been after the first reading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Isadora was not one of the servants who had known
and loved Katherine, and so it is not surprising that
when she opened the door and saw her standing there
with her suitcase she took her for an agent. Katherine
did not enlighten Isadora as to her identity, for
she wanted to see Kate first of all, and for the present
Kate only. She made this very plain, and then
walked past Isadora and into the drawing-room with
such an air that in spite of the old black velvet tam
and general lack of style in the caller&rsquo;s clothes, Isadora
accorded her all due respect and went in search
of Kate.</p>
<p>But Kate was not to be found in the house.
Would the caller wait? Yes? Very well. Isadora
withdrew with several curious backward glances.</p>
<p>As soon as Isadora was out of the way Katherine
went through the French doors on to the terrace.
She paced back and forth, looking toward the orchard
house. Was Kate there? Had she forgotten the
time? The maid Isadora had appeared calm and
collected enough. There certainly was a sense of
peace in the house. The &ldquo;mix-up&rdquo; perhaps was not
such a desperate one, after all. Katherine couldn&rsquo;t
wait here, though, doing nothing&mdash;not after all those
hours of waiting on the train. She walked across the
terrace and down into the garden toward the orchard
house. She met Kate just at the edge of the trees.</p>
<p>Kate returned her mother&rsquo;s embrace and kiss
almost absently. Then Katherine held her off and
looked at her. &ldquo;You look all right,&rdquo; she said, breathlessly.
&ldquo;Kate, tell me nothing dreadful has happened.
Tell me you <i>are</i> all right. Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Oh, Mother, don&rsquo;t look like that!
I am perfectly all right. It&rsquo;s about <i>Elsie</i>. But
even that&rsquo;s all right now. Mother, her father is here.
Nick is in the orchard house. He wants to see you.
He says it may be the last time you ever see each
other. He wants you to come right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>But if Kate&rsquo;s words reassured Katherine about
Kate&rsquo;s safety, they flung her into a new anxiety.
&ldquo;Nick? The last time? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Only come.&rdquo; Kate pulled
at her mother&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Nick had come down the stairs and was waiting
in the hall. When Katherine followed Kate dazedly
in, and she and Nick stood facing each other, he exclaimed
involuntarily; to him it was as though the
girl of eighteen he had known years ago had come
back. In the black velvet tam, raindrops sparkling
in her hair that waved so softly at her ears and brow,
raindrops drenching her eyelashes, her face vivid
with emotion, her hands outstretched to him&mdash;why,
she was as young and fresh as Kate herself, more
beautiful even than he had remembered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must talk with you.&rdquo; He was very intense and
at the same time shy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Of course we must talk.&rdquo;
Katherine&rsquo;s tone implied, &ldquo;Why not? Why shouldn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the parlour, then. I&rsquo;ll put up a window.
No, I can&rsquo;t do that. Someone in the house might
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t someone see? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s air enough from the door now. Smell
the syringa!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Katherine was standing in the window, her back
to them. Kate knew it was to hide strange tears.
&ldquo;The smell of the syringa did that,&rdquo; she thought,
with her quick understanding where her mother was
concerned. &ldquo;Smells are funny that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick spoke to Kate then, with gentle imperativeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie will be coming out here in a minute. Yes,
we are running away, if you like. Go to her and tell
her to wait. Tell her we will go surely to-night, but
she is to wait until your mother comes in. You keep
her, Kate&mdash;stay with her&mdash;<i>until your mother comes
in</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could. She will be furious with
me. She wouldn&rsquo;t do what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write her a note. She will understand that I
want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled an envelope from his pocket and
scrawled a sentence, holding the paper against the
wall. Katherine had taken off her coat and was
now sitting in the deep chair in the window. Her
tears had vanished, if there really had been tears, and
her eyes were clear as happiness itself.</p>
<p>But Kate was anxious as she hurried with the note
to Elsie. If Elsie had hated her before for interfering
now she would hate her all the more.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the window seat in her room,
dressed in the green silk suit and brown straw hat, a
bright green raincoat thrown over a chair back near,
and the suitcase of last night at her feet. Had she
seen Kate come from the orchard house and return
there with her mother? It was obvious that she had,
for the face she turned to Kate was wild and strained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing now?&rdquo; she asked as
Kate came into the room. &ldquo;Who was that girl you
took into the orchard house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a girl. It was my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father wanted to talk to her. He sent you
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie took the note and her face lost some of its
wildness as she read. When she looked up she was
puzzled but almost serene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;re going away just the same,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Nothing can stop us now. I&rsquo;m only
to wait until your mother comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate nodded. If it was her father Elsie was running
away with, she, Kate, had no more responsibility.
She didn&rsquo;t see how it was fair to Aunt
Katherine or in any way right for them to do it that
way, but she had no doubt that somehow it could
be explained. Once understood, there would be no
question of its rightness. So she put all that aside.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;Oh, Elsie, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me your
father wrote &lsquo;The King of the Fairies&rsquo;? Your very
own father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know now? He told you? Well, now
you know, then, that I didn&rsquo;t lie. There <i>was</i> something
of fairy in the orchard house; Father had
finished his new book there. It&rsquo;s all fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going away now, for good? Before
Aunt Katherine comes back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you will let me.&rdquo; Needless to say this was
spoken sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course. Now that I&rsquo;ve seen your father!
No harm can come to you now, not when you&rsquo;ve
got our talisman, alive, real, to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked at Kate, puzzled. &ldquo;What do you
mean? Your talisman? You do say the queerest
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kate told her about the boy in the silvery,
dragony, flowery picture frame. When she had
finished, it was a new Elsie that faced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother, too, felt like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, too. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ELSIE CONFIDES</span></h2>
<p>The girls stayed there, sitting on the window
seat, for over an hour, watching for Katherine
to come from the orchard. It was showering again,
sheets of rain silvering the gardens and drawing curtains
of silver magic about the orchard, swirling
them all about the orchard&rsquo;s borders. There was
plenty of time for the story which Elsie told haphazardly
and in broken sentences, led on by Kate&rsquo;s
interest, and her assurances that now she had seen
Nick she would never try to interfere with any of
their plans again. Kate&rsquo;s story of the dragony,
flowery picture frame had knocked all Elsie&rsquo;s guards
flat, too. Her story, straightened out, was this:</p>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s earliest memory was of her father. She
had fallen down the house steps and bumped her
head. Nick, her father, had appeared as by magic
to kiss the hurt away and run back into the house
with her in his arms. She remembered him bending
over her, washing the bruise with cold water; then
came the smell of witch-hazel. And though this
was her first conscious memory, still the very memory
itself held in it the inevitableness of this comfort
from her father; so she was used to his ministrations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>The next memory was convalescence after measles
when she was four. She was sitting up in a chair in
a window over the street, wrapped in an eiderdown.
Her father was reading to her from &ldquo;The Psalms of
David.&rdquo; The words sang a beautiful song to her,
especially when he came to &ldquo;The Lord is my Shepherd.&rdquo;
And it was very comforting to have her
father sitting there so quietly, near her, as though he
meant to stay a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your mother?&rdquo; Kate asked her. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
she read to you after measles, too? Don&rsquo;t you remember
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Elsie remembered her mother, though she
thought it was a later memory, and it was never a
memory of <i>mothering</i>. Gloria had hummed in and
out of the house like a humming-bird. Later, when
Elsie saw a humming-bird for the first time, she felt
as she watched it exactly as she had always felt
watching her mother; and the pains that she took not
to startle the little spirit away were exactly the pains
she had always taken not to startle her mother away,
when by chance she hummed near. Gloria looked
like a humming-bird, as well as acted like one.
Humming-birds fascinated Elsie, and her mother
had always entranced her with the same fascination,
no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>But sometimes the humming-bird scolded at her
father, pecked at him, hummed all about him pecking.
Then Elsie would run away, not fascinated
any more. The scolding was always about money.
Gloria needed money just as a humming-bird needs
honey, and often there wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>They lived in New York near Washington Square.
Elsie was cared for by nurses&mdash;such a fast-marching
procession of nurses in the same chic blue uniforms,
provided by the humming-bird, that Elsie remembered
them as &ldquo;nurse,&rdquo; not as individuals. Her
father was the constant human factor in her life, the
one person to be counted on. Gloria was merely a
dash of colour beyond the nursery door somewhere,
a shrill sweet voice at the piano, a swish of silk on
the stairs.</p>
<p>At eight, Elsie was sent to boarding school. But
the school was in New York, and so her father still
saw her almost every day, and on Saturdays he gave
her and sometimes her friends &ldquo;treats.&rdquo; He took
them to the theatre or picture galleries, or for beautiful
walks in Central Park. Her mother never
came to the school, but had her home once a month
on Sundays for dinner. This was a grief to Elsie,
not because she felt any need of her mother but
simply because she would have been proud to show
her schoolmates what a magnificent and fashionable
mother she had; also she was humiliated by their
curious questionings and pretended doubts as to
whether she had a real mother at all. But Elsie
was sure that her father was better than twenty
mothers. She wouldn&rsquo;t take a mother as a gift
except for show purposes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Kate writhed at Elsie&rsquo;s harshness. &ldquo;Oh, you
don&rsquo;t know, Elsie! Don&rsquo;t talk so! How can you?
It is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Ermina said when I talked to her
about my mother. Ermina was my best friend, but
she didn&rsquo;t stay out her first year at school. Her
mother died, and she went home for the funeral and
never came back. I knew that she loved her
mother just as much as I loved my father. I hid
away in my room when they told me her mother
had died. I pretended I was sick. It was awful.
But when I heard her go downstairs, at the very
last minute while they were saying &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; to
her at the door, I rushed down in my nightgown.
I kissed her and hugged her and we cried terribly.
Miss Putnam, the principal of the school, never forgave
me for having made Ermina cry when she had
been brave and not cried at all before, and for having
disgraced the school by standing in the door in my
nightgown. But I have been glad ever since. I had
to say &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; and that I was sorry. And I
don&rsquo;t think crying out loud was any worse than the
crying <i>inside</i> that Ermina must have been doing.
Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate agreed with Elsie. She, too, was glad Elsie
had gone to her friend in her sorrow, even if she had
waited till the last minute for the courage.</p>
<p>Vacations had been spent either at camps or at
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s. When they were spent at Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s, her father was usually with her, having
a vacation, too. And those were beautiful times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>Then, when she was twelve, came the terrible time.
Nick had done badly in business. He confided this
to Elsie because Gloria only wanted happy confidences,
and besides, she was abroad, travelling
with a party of friends. There was enough to pay
his debts and leave him clear to start fresh, avoiding
bankruptcy. But the debts paid, and his checking
account reduced to zero, money must come from
somewhere to go on with until business picked up.
He knew a way in which two thousand dollars, if
he only had it, could overnight be turned into ten
thousand. He told Elsie about it, walking in Central
Park, and said if he had only waited a little to
pay his debts, and not acted so hastily in his fear of
bankruptcy, everything would have been made right
now. Aunt Katherine would loan him the two
thousand, he felt sure, if he could only explain the
nature of the speculation to her. But she was travelling
somewhere in England, and there would never
be time to get into touch with her. But he had the
key to her safety vault in her Boston bank. He suddenly
told Elsie that he was going to Boston and
would not see her again until Sunday. She understood
that he was going to borrow, on his own account,
two thousand dollars from Aunt Katherine
overnight, trusting to her unfailing generosity.</p>
<p>Nick wrote Aunt Katherine all about it on the
train as he went. From the vault he took two
thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of securities which could
easily be replaced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>Aunt Katherine sailed for home before Nick&rsquo;s
troubled letter reached her in England, and the second
letter, telling how the two thousand instead of
blossoming into ten thousand had disappeared altogether,
was never sent, because just as Nick was
going out of his door to post it, the cablegram came
announcing Gloria&rsquo;s tragic death. That put all
thoughts of the letter out of his mind, and when
he did remember it he thought he had posted it as
he meant to. It was found in the apartment months
later by the people who sublet the place furnished,
and simply dropped into a post box by them and sent
to its address in England. It did not reach Miss
Frazier until six months later.</p>
<p>Miss Frazier on her arrival in Boston, and after
a visit to her bank, reported the missing securities
to the police. Nick&rsquo;s immediate apprehension followed.
Miss Frazier was on a train bound for California
when that most amazing bit of news reached
her by telegram. She was shocked almost beyond
reason, and so horrified that it was impossible for
her to find any justification for her adopted nephew.
She offered him no help and had no words for him
that were not bitter ones, but she did write to offer
his &ldquo;innocent child&rdquo; a home with her on the condition
that she should not speak her father&rsquo;s name
for the term of his imprisonment, or correspond with
him while she was in her care. That letter ended,
&ldquo;If I had been one half as level-headed as my
niece Katherine or Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith about you,
Nicholas, I should have protected you against such
temptation, and we might have all been spared this
catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>In Elsie&rsquo;s parting from her father he had shown her
this letter. (Now Kate knew why Elsie had grown
cold always at mention of Katherine!) He had
begged her to accept her aunt&rsquo;s conditions. Indeed
there was nothing else she could do, for her mother&rsquo;s
relations were now more estranged from them than
ever. They had not written one word, even bitter
ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Elsie! That must have been dreadful, not
being allowed even to speak of your father, to act as
though he were dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked at her, her eyes black with remembered
grief. &ldquo;It was. I was so lonely for him, Kate, I
expected to <i>die</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time Nick&rsquo;s two letters about the &ldquo;overnight
loan,&rdquo; forwarded and reforwarded, had arrived
in Oakdale. Then Aunt Katherine began to
understand a little how his deed had not been so
pitchy black as it had seemed in the first shock. He
had done what she had always wanted him to do,
counted on her understanding and generosity. It
had been a crime&mdash;even Nick had accepted that
judgment from the very first&mdash;and an utterly foolish
and desperate deed, but now Aunt Katherine was
sorry she had not lifted a hand to keep him from
paying the penalty of imprisonment. She looked
about to see what could be done, and ultimately was
able to set wheels in motion that brought about his
release at the end of two years instead of three. But
she had not told Elsie. She had not been able to
bring herself to speak of Elsie&rsquo;s father to her at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Nick wrote Miss Frazier asking her to meet him
at a certain spot on the Common in Boston the day
he was to be released. He wanted to discuss Elsie
and what they were to do about her. He knew that
his appearance in Oakdale would cause Miss Frazier
painful embarrassment. He meant to avoid that
for her. But when he had waited for hours at the
place he had designated and she had not come, he
had grown desperate. He was obsessed with a fear
that Elsie might be sick. Why, she might be dead,
almost, for all he knew. He had not had one word
from her in two years. He boarded a train, not
stopping to leave his suitcase at a hotel or check it
in the South Station, and started for Oakdale.</p>
<p>Elsie was just coming down the steps of Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s house as her father got out of the taxi
he had hired to avoid being seen in Oakdale and to
gain speed to his destination. Aunt Katherine was
away and most of the servants, for it was Thursday
afternoon&mdash;a week ago last Thursday. Father and
daughter had longed to be alone, unobserved by any
curious eyes. The orchard house occurred to them
as the best place to talk. They went around the
house and managed to reach it, unseen, through
the gardens. They had climbed in at a window at
the back. Elsie was beside herself with happiness,
and Nick was like a boy in his joy and relief about
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>He told Elsie that the first year in prison he had
written &ldquo;The King of the Fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was so much in it that he had told
me about the &lsquo;other side of things&rsquo; and the <i>more</i>
life that even stones have that we don&rsquo;t see, that
when the book was published and I looked into it
at the bookshop I knew right away it must be
Father&rsquo;s. He had always wanted to write. At the
very first sentence I knew. It was like a letter from
him. I read it and read it and read it. Do you
wonder I didn&rsquo;t want you to snatch it for yourself
that very first morning, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second book was almost finished when Nick
came out of prison. Only a chapter remained. The
publishers had promised an advance on the royalties
as soon as the manuscript was sent them. The first
book had already made over two thousand dollars.
So the two decided, between them, that Nick should
live in the orchard house for a week, long enough to
finish the book, send it to the publishers and get their
check. Then he would leave the two thousand dollars,
the earnings from the first book, for Aunt
Katherine. That was exactly what he had taken
from her vault. With the new check of five hundred
dollars, he and Elsie would go away together. He
could write in the orchard house undisturbed, and
without any one&rsquo;s knowing he was there. Elsie
could bring him some food now and then. But they
would not run away together until he could leave the
two thousand that really belonged to Aunt Katherine
behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>Kate interrupted there. &ldquo;But how can you! How
can you treat Aunt Katherine so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way. I&rsquo;ve made Father see that she
doesn&rsquo;t like me. She is awfully kind, but that&rsquo;s not
liking. If I vanish, it will be just a relief to her.
But she wouldn&rsquo;t let me go, probably, if I told her.
She would argue and try to keep me because it was
her duty. Even Father sees that. Well, the new
check has come. That was my special delivery
yesterday. Father wrote Aunt Katherine a long
letter and put the two thousand dollars in checks
from his publishers into it. I&rsquo;ve pinned the letter to
her pincushion for her to read when she gets back
to-night. Father hopes you&rsquo;ll stay on here and your
mother come back, too, and everything be set right at
last. We don&rsquo;t belong in the Frazier family at all,
you know. We are sort of vagabonds, different,
Father and I. Father thinks the quarrel between
Aunt Katherine and your mother was in some way
because of him. When we vanish, it will come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it won&rsquo;t, and it wasn&rsquo;t, and you aren&rsquo;t.
Imagine you a vagabond!&rdquo; Kate exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beautiful clothes Aunt Katherine gives
me. They make me look just like anybody. But
really underneath I belong in a tent or something like
that. Anyway, I&rsquo;d rather tramp the country with
my father than live in a palace with any one else!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Kate leaned toward her, taking her hand, not
timidly now but with assurance. &ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; she
agreed, heartily. &ldquo;So would any one, he&rsquo;s so splendid
and wonderful. And we are friends now, you and I,
aren&rsquo;t we? Will you write to me when you have
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears brimmed Elsie&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Really? Do you
want me to write? Of course I will. Let&rsquo;s be best
friends, chums. Even when I&rsquo;m in California!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was embarrassed by the tears, but she was
enraptured, too. She was tingling with happiness,
for she was face to face with the vanishing comrade
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we feel this way sooner?&rdquo; she asked
with reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my fault. I&rsquo;m sorry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had almost forgotten why they were
watching the rain-curtained orchard. But they
were recalled sharply to the affairs of the minute by
Effie&rsquo;s voice in the hall not far from their door. She
was calling down a stairway to Isadora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Julia Miss Frazier&rsquo;s just come in and will be
here for dinner, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls started. Elsie sprang to her feet. Kate
still had her hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said, quickly.
&ldquo;I will help you to get out without her seeing. You
can go later to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Father&rsquo;s note! Pinned to her pincushion!
She will read it now! Oh, why did she come back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her room and try to get the note before
she notices it,&rdquo; Kate offered. &ldquo;You just wait here.
I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on top of the tall bureau against the wall
between the windows. Oh, do you suppose you <i>can</i>,
Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Kate hurried through the passageways toward
Miss Frazier&rsquo;s bedroom she wondered whether she
really could. What excuse should she give for disturbing
Aunt Katherine while she was dressing?</p>
<p>There was no time to think that out. Aunt
Katherine called &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; almost before Kate&rsquo;s
knuckles tapped the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FAREWELL IN THE DARK</span></h2>
<p>Miss Frazier was sitting before her dressing
table attired in a blue silk dressing-robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter, Kate?&rdquo; she asked, the
minute that she realized it was Kate and not one of
the servants who had entered. &ldquo;Bertha tells me
Elsie is better. I am glad I was able to get back for
dinner, after all. Both you and Elsie have been on
my mind. Was it a dull day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not dull a bit.&rdquo; If Aunt Katherine only
knew how very far from dull!</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine put down the comb with which she
had been &ldquo;fluffing&rdquo; her hair. She looked at Kate
questioningly. Why was her niece here, and looking
so discomfited, at the dressing hour?</p>
<p>Kate had already spied the note, across the room,
pinned to the pincushion on the bureau&rsquo;s top. To
the corner of her eye it appeared as big as a flag!
How had Miss Frazier ever avoided seeing it? It
fairly shrieked in the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Her aunt was expecting something of
her. She must say something to make her presence
reasonable. But what excuse could she ever make
to go &rsquo;way across the big room to that bureau? In
this plight Kate blurted out the news that her mother
was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine seemed frozen for an instant in
her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly here, but she will be in a few minutes,
I think,&rdquo; Kate stumbled on. &ldquo;I wired for her to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kate! Has anything gone wrong to-day?
Elsie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing. Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you now. Will
you wait a little while, until she&rsquo;s here? I can&rsquo;t
explain anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is she arriving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate put her hand into her pocket and pulled out
the yellow telegram. &ldquo;Here, this tells,&rdquo; she said,
vaguely. Now, oh, now while Aunt Katherine was
studying out that long message was the time to
rescue Elsie&rsquo;s letter. Kate made a move toward the
bureau. But Miss Frazier moved with her! Her
lorgnette lay beside the pincushion! Was there ever
such luck!</p>
<p>She picked it up, and read, moving the glass along
the paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>She passed over the ambiguity to her of most of
the message and fastened her attention upon the time
of arrival stated there. &ldquo;Five-five!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;The train must be over an hour late. More than
that. It&rsquo;s half-past six now. Ring the bell, please,
Kate, and tell Isadora to send Timothy to the station.
He knows your mother and will bring her up here in
the car when the train does get in. That back-way
train is seldom on schedule, but this is unusually late.
Tell Isadora to have an extra place laid, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate went over to the door and rang the servants&rsquo;
bell there. Bertha, not Isadora, answered. Kate
stepped out into the hall and whispered quickly,
&ldquo;Tell Effie to set another place. My mother will
be here for dinner.&rdquo; The directions for Timothy
were, of course, not given. Then Kate went back
to her aunt, with how beating a heart!</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine was standing with her face turned
away, reading Nick&rsquo;s letter. Kate never thought of
fleeing. She stayed stock still, waiting for the storm,
and deciding that even now Aunt Katherine need not
know that Elsie had not yet gone. Kate expected
something quite scenic from her aunt&rsquo;s temper.
Katherine had warned her that it was rare but
devastating.</p>
<p>After ages and &aelig;ons, to Kate&rsquo;s tense mind, Aunt
Katherine folded the letter, check and all. Then
their eyes met. The one thing that the expression
in her aunt&rsquo;s eyes told Kate was that she was surprised,
though <i>glad</i>, to find her still there. She
stretched both her hands to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate, Kate,&rdquo; she said with a rising inflection of
happiness in her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been all wrong, wrong
about Elsie&rsquo;s father, but even more wrong about
Elsie! She has proved that by running away with
her father. The blessed darling! The poor lamb!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Kate felt that she was on a merry-go-round of
surprises. &ldquo;You are glad she has run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I be anything but rejoiced!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate turned a little cold at that. &ldquo;And you
won&rsquo;t try to stop them?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no need. Nick says he will give me their
address as soon as they have one. Then I shall go
to them, wherever it is. I will bring them back.
Kate, she must <i>adore</i> her father! And all the while,
just because she kept the agreement not to speak of
him, I thought her indifferent to his sufferings, and
unnatural. Why, from this, she must have suffered
more than he.&rdquo; Miss Frazier tapped the folded
letter with her lorgnette. &ldquo;He says that when he
looked in at your party and saw Elsie so beautifully
gowned, and having such a good time, his heart
failed him; he decided that he must not take her
away from all this. But Elsie herself made him see
that she would never be happy anywhere but with
him no matter how poor they were. It was Elsie
who insisted on this harebrained scheme of running
away! Elsie, who I thought hadn&rsquo;t a grain of spirit
or affection! Why, I&rsquo;m just turned topsy-turvy by
it all! Bless that poor child! And Nick wrote &lsquo;The
King of the Fairies.&rsquo; I ought to have guessed that
instantly. Bless him, I say, too, the poor, abused,
misguided poet. Do you remember St. Francis?
You know he, too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Frazier broke off in her song of praise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child, you,&rdquo; she cried, meaning Kate.
&ldquo;This must all be a mystery. We&rsquo;ll wait till your
mother is here. Then we can talk it all over.&rdquo; She
hugged Kate as she spoke, much as though she herself
were a young girl in the most exuberant of
spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall wear my black lace,&rdquo; she said, pushing
Kate laughingly away from her. &ldquo;We must be
gorgeous for your mother. Hurry into your pink
organdie. Why, she may be at the door this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus freed, Kate flew to Elsie. Elsie was waiting,
almost ill with anxiety. &ldquo;Did you manage it?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And she has read the letter. But she is
<i>glad</i>, Elsie. There&rsquo;s just to be no trouble about your
getting away with your father at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you!&rdquo; Elsie exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
as I knew. She is glad to be rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must plan quickly, though. How will you
get out? It&rsquo;s so dark now you can&rsquo;t see the orchard
well at all. Let&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Bertha was there, flushed and nervous. That
morning Elsie had found it necessary to confide the
secret of her father&rsquo;s being in the orchard house to
Bertha, if he was to have any breakfast or lunch that
day at all. They had let the food supply get very
low, she and her father, because, until he had looked
in at the party, they had expected to fly last night.
Bertha was horrified at finding herself part of the
intrigue, but there was no help for it since Elsie
could always &ldquo;Wind her around her little finger.&rdquo;
Now, the almost distracted maid promised to stand
by Elsie until the end. It would be the end for her
as well as Elsie, for she would certainly lose her place
to-morrow, and her character with it. For if Miss
Frazier did not become aware for herself that Bertha
had taken food to Nick in the orchard house this
morning, and protected Elsie from the betrayal of
her plans, Bertha meant to confess these things to
her.</p>
<p>The three in conclave now decided that Elsie
should go, after Kate and Miss Frazier were in the
drawing-room, to the window seat on the stair landing.
There she could conceal herself behind the
curtains with her suitcase until Kate came out into
the hall below, on some pretext to be found by her,
and whistled softly. The whistle would mean that
Katherine had come in and that Elsie could slip away
to the orchard house unobserved.</p>
<p>All this was rather fun for Kate except for the sorry
fact that when it was over she would have lost a
comrade. To help stage a real runaway&mdash;well, it
doesn&rsquo;t happen every day that one may be so at
the centre of exciting events.</p>
<p>With Bertha&rsquo;s help Kate was dashing into her organdie
while Elsie stood in a balcony window watching
the orchard. Elsie had come in to be near Kate
until the very last minute. But when a knock suddenly
sounded on Kate&rsquo;s door Elsie wisely whisked
away into her own room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Kate called in a tremulous voice. Was
it her mother? No, it was Aunt Katherine, and very
fortunate it was that Elsie had been spry in her
whisking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are dressed,&rdquo; Miss Frazier said. &ldquo;Come
down, with me, then, and we will be together in the
drawing-room when your mother arrives. I have
ordered dinner delayed for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate thought quickly. &ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in Elsie&rsquo;s room I need. Will you
wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate closed the door behind her as though by
accident. But Elsie was not in the room. Kate
looked all around but it was quite empty. The
vanishing comrade had vanished, physically this
time. There was the closet door. Was she hiding
there? Yes, Kate heard a stir and saw dimly
through the hanging dresses&mdash;expensive dresses given
Elsie by Aunt Katherine, which she was not taking
with her&mdash;Elsie herself squeezed back against the
farthest wall. Kate closed the closet door behind
her and groped her way across the dark closet.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Kate,&rdquo; she whispered loudly.</p>
<p>The girls touched hands in the dark. They
hugged and kissed each other, mostly on noses and
ears, but no matter; it was a grief-stricken parting.
&ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye,&rdquo; they whispered, and Kate
said, &ldquo;Write to me from California.&rdquo; But she must
hurry back before it came into Miss Frazier&rsquo;s head
to follow her in here with the idea of going through
Elsie&rsquo;s door into the hall. She ran back to her own
room and in her anxiety created the impression of a
small cyclone appearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Miss Frazier looked with some surprise on the
violence of her return. Then her eyes softened.
Kate had not given thought to drying her tears.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take it like this,&rdquo; Aunt Katherine said,
putting her arm through Kate&rsquo;s as they went down
the passageways together toward the big upper hall.
&ldquo;Elsie is happier than she has been in a very long
time; she is off with one of the most satisfying companions
in the world. Nick will take good care of
her, infinitely better care than was ever taken here
by me, for he <i>knows her mind</i>. And oh, Kate, we
mustn&rsquo;t let your mother run away with you, too.
Then I <i>should</i> be alone! You won&rsquo;t be without
companionship. There are the Dentons just next
door, and plenty of others who will be wanting to
know you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t Elsie,&rdquo; Kate responded, shamelessly
using her handkerchief, as the tears would keep
flooding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LIKE THE STARS</span></h2>
<p>Miss Frazier was too excitedly nervous to
take up a book or knitting when they were in
the drawing-room. She wandered about, looking at
the pictures on the walls, picking up magazines from
tables to stare at them vacantly and replace them
again, changing the arrangements of flowers, and all
the time she was waiting for the sound of the opening
front door and Katherine&rsquo;s step in the hall. Kate
was listening, too, but not in that direction. She
expected her mother to come through the gardens
and in at one of the French doors, closed now, with
the rain beating against them. Kate was so absorbed
with the consciousness of Elsie waiting up on
the stair landing for her chance to escape that she
forgot her mother had no umbrella and that she
might be waiting in the orchard house until this
particular shower passed. She merely wondered
what was keeping her all this time, and what would
happen when she and Aunt Katherine met. Aunt
Katherine would certainly be surprised when she
caught sight of the expected traveller through the
glass doors on the terrace. There would be questions
and explanations about that. Nick would have
warned Katherine, of course, not to give away the
secret of his being there; but then what <i>would</i> she
give as her explanation to Aunt Katherine?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>Would she be expecting to find Aunt Katherine
here at all, though? Wouldn&rsquo;t Nick have acquainted
her with the fact of Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s supposed
absence? In that case Katherine, unprepared, would
be hard put to it to give any excuse for entering
through the gardens from the back, rather than by
the front door, ushered in by Isadora. Kate was on
tenter-hooks. She felt that it was she herself who
had caused the muddle. But what could she have
done differently? If she had told Aunt Katherine,
up in her room, that Katherine was here already,
only out in the orchard house, Aunt Katherine would
certainly have gone straight out there, and then
what would have happened to Nick and Elsie?</p>
<p>It was a bad ten minutes for Kate. She sat with
a book open before her&mdash;what book she never knew&mdash;her
eyes glued to the page, her ears cocked for a
sound beyond the glass doors. Aunt Katherine
stopped before her in her wanderings once or twice,
about to speak, but she had too much respect for a
reader to break into such obvious absorption as was
Kate&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Now Miss Frazier was standing looking through
the glass of one of the doors into the rain-swept
garden. Kate was seized with an idea. She must
run up to Elsie in the window seat&mdash;she must manage
it without her aunt&rsquo;s noticing, now&mdash;and send Elsie
to the orchard house to warn those two that Miss
Frazier had returned. After that, responsibility
would be theirs. They might fix up some scheme
among them. Kate rose, softly, and took a step
toward the hall. But she was halted by an exclamation
from Aunt Katherine.</p>
<p>Miss Frazier had not turned; she was still looking
out through the glass. Kate, looking, too, saw two
figures just at the edge of the orchard. It was her
mother and Nick. Well, she could do nothing now.
They certainly were counting on Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s
absence, for they were coming toward the house.
They were running toward the house, &ldquo;between the
drops,&rdquo; dashing like school children. They were
holding hands, and Nick was always a step ahead,
rather dragging Katherine. Oh, why hadn&rsquo;t Kate
thought about an umbrella! They were laughing!
Kate heard their laughter through the glass. So did
Aunt Katherine. Her face, taken at that moment,
would have made a perfect mask to personify Surprise.</p>
<p>She opened the doors, and Katherine and Nick
blew through them like two drenched leaves. The
rain had blurred the glass, and the running pair had
thought it was Kate standing there watching them
and letting them in. When they saw that it was
Aunt Katherine they stood and simply <i>stared</i>, with
almost no expression, still gripping each other&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>Miss Frazier&rsquo;s first words were unexpected ones.
&ldquo;Where is Elsie?&rdquo; she asked Nick. That was all,
just &ldquo;Where is Elsie?&rdquo; as though that, for the
instant, was the thing of prime importance to her.
It was Kate who could answer, though. Timidly
she said, &ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s up on the stair landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right, then. I thought she might
be in search of a father in the South Station or some
place. I thought, Nick, you two, you and Elsie,
had run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick said, &ldquo;We were going to. It is Katherine
who has stopped us at the very minute.&rdquo; He still
held Katherine&rsquo;s hand. Now he turned and looked
at her. She looked back at him. Both Aunt
Katherine and Kate, seeing what passed between
their eyes, gasped. But it forewarned them, and
Katherine&rsquo;s words when she spoke were only an
echo of what they had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick and I are getting married, Aunt Katherine.
We didn&rsquo;t know you were here, or we wouldn&rsquo;t have
burst in like this. We had come to tell our children.
Won&rsquo;t you get Elsie, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Nick marrying? So at last you&rsquo;ve
come to your senses!&rdquo; That was Aunt Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And oh, Aunt Katherine, she knows everything
about me, and still she wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course she knows everything about you.
I fancy <i>that&rsquo;s</i> had publicity enough. But if this is
the way you feel, Katherine, why didn&rsquo;t you write
me one word when Nick got himself into trouble?
Or since? Your silence has been as cruel as any part
of it all. It said plainer than words, &lsquo;Like Mrs.
Van Vorst-Smith, I expected this sort of thing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Katherine! How can you? If I
had known Nick was in prison, that something so
terrible had happened, I should have written you
right away. No, I should have come. Trouble like
that would have brought us all together. But how
could I know, when nobody told me?&rdquo; Katherine&rsquo;s
beautiful eyes were like a grieved, accusing child&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;And what hard-shelled little creatures we are!
Why couldn&rsquo;t my <i>soul</i> have told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about your soul telling you.&rdquo; Aunt
Katherine was brusque. &ldquo;What about your eyes?
Don&rsquo;t you ever read the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine dropped her head. She had probably
often dropped it so in the past before her aunt.
&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, softly apologetic, &ldquo;I never
did read the papers as you do, Aunt Katherine, or
keep up with current events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine laughed. It was a nice laugh.
Kate visualized their brook in Ashland, when the ice
was dissolving under the sun in the spring. (Yes,
she did. It may seem a strange time for her mind to
wander so far, but the fact remains. She saw the
brook that zigzagged through the meadows back of
their barn-house, as she had seen it last spring, its
edges still frosted with ice, but down the centre the
clear, laughing water coursing.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the news of Nick would hardly come under
&lsquo;current events&rsquo;,&rdquo; Aunt Katherine was saying.
&ldquo;But I do remember now that you never did take a
proper interest in the papers. It never entered my
head, though, that you wouldn&rsquo;t have learned of this
from a dozen sources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had been backing away toward the door,
meaning to go for Elsie. But there was no need.
Elsie had heard her father&rsquo;s voice the minute he had
come into the drawing-room. She had stolen down
into the room now, and gripped Kate&rsquo;s hand. Together
the two girls moved back toward the three who
were earnestly talking, still standing near the open
door with the rain, all unobserved, discolouring the
polished floor.</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine was asking Katherine another
question. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take Nick seventeen
years ago?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You seem sure enough of
yourself now. He wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you
then. Is he good enough now after all that has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Katherine cried, &ldquo;How can you!&rdquo; But
quickly she amended it. &ldquo;Yes, you have a right.
You know yourself, Aunt Katherine, what was the
matter with me. It was pride of birth, blindness,
love of luxury, Mrs. Van Vorst-Smith&rsquo;s head-shakings,
a jumble of folly. You know perfectly
what sort of a girl I was. But now I&rsquo;m different.
Now I&rsquo;m nearer to being good enough for Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;Love of luxury!&rdquo; Miss Frazier picked on that.
&ldquo;You want me to believe your horrid description
of yourself? If you loved luxury so much, why have
you been living as you have all these years, accepting
nothing of the luxuries I longed to give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I changed. At twenty-two I was
different from nineteen. I welcomed poverty then.
When they told me that Kate and I had actually
nothing to live on, I was delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it has been by way of penance, your hard life
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to call it that. It&rsquo;s been fun, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not fun for me.&rdquo; Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s eyes
filled with tears. For a person of Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s
character to cry openly like that was as extraordinary
a happening as though she had suddenly begun walking
on her hands. Only Katherine dared speak to
her or try to offer comfort. She put her arms around
her shoulders, and led her to a chair. There she
made her sit down, and knelt by her side, leaning her
head against her arm, stroking her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, Aunt Katherine. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
besought. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t bear it. Oh, what have I
done to you! What have we both done to you,
Nick and I? Forgive us, Aunt Katherine. Love us
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, even in the midst of her tears, Aunt
Katherine laughed, and as before Kate remembered
the brook. &ldquo;Again!&rdquo; Aunt Katherine exclaimed.
&ldquo;Did you think I had ever stopped loving either of
you mad children?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>Nick nodded. &ldquo;<i>I</i> have forfeited your affection
right enough. I understand why you couldn&rsquo;t meet
me, Aunt Katherine, two weeks ago when I asked you
to. At least I understand now. I shouldn&rsquo;t have
asked it. But how else were we to decide about
Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine looked up at her adopted nephew,
remembering. &ldquo;But of course I did go to meet
you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t! I read
the day, though, &lsquo;Thursday&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Tuesday.&rsquo;
It&rsquo;s not often I blunder so stupidly. Then I made
frantic efforts to locate you. But you had vanished.
There wasn&rsquo;t a trace. I set private detectives to
work. To-day they took me all the way to Springfield
on a wild-goose chase. They were sure they
had located you there. Clever, those detectives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Katherine dried her eyes thoroughly as she
spoke. She was scornful of her tears. &ldquo;That
excursion has tired me,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;The
disappointment of it. I was so downhearted. Then
having you suddenly here again, right here at home,
without warning, safe and happy&mdash;well, perhaps
a sphinx would cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Nick&rsquo;s turn to kneel and rub his cheek
against Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s shoulder. She lifted a
hand and stroked his hair. Kate, too, got as close
to her aunt as she could. Only Elsie stood aloof, for
an instant not in any way part of the group. It was
Aunt Katherine who beckoned her, and took her
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have been thinking you hard
and selfish because you kept my rule not to mention
your father. I have wanted to speak with you of
him, but every time I led up to it I thought you drew
away. It seemed to me that you were suffering, not
for him, but for your own wounded vanity. Now I
understand better. Perhaps, in time, you will forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was Elsie&rsquo;s turn to cry, and she did it so
whole-heartedly that the family devoted its complete
attention to calming her.</p>
<p>It was later that Miss Frazier exclaimed as though
she had just remembered it: &ldquo;So you two children
are to be married, and Katherine become a Frazier
again! I wonder what Oakdale will say to that turn
of affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really care what they say, Aunt Katherine&rdquo;&mdash;Katherine
spoke quickly&mdash;&ldquo;need they know
at all? Ashland society notes will hardly penetrate
here. And you&rsquo;ve had quite enough to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you could ever hide such a famous
author as Nick has become, with only his first book,
under a bushel for long, my dear. And as a matter
of fact, quite apart from my joy that you are acting
like a sane girl at last, and for once, I shall be proud
to death of the marriage. I must call up the <i>Gazette</i>
to-morrow, before ten. You remind me, Kate.&rdquo; As
well as pride there was a gleam of battle from Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it really doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit what they do
say, except for you, Aunt Katherine,&rdquo; Katherine
offered. &ldquo;There are four of us now, four in this
family. Enough of us to stand together, I should
think, and not ask much from society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four? Five!&rdquo; Kate left Elsie&rsquo;s side on the divan
to perch on the arm of her great-aunt&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;Why,
five of us are quite enough to start a colony and make
our own society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, dear child, for counting me in,&rdquo; Miss
Frazier said with sheerest gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course, we all count you in, and there <i>are</i>
five of us,&rdquo; Katherine cried, &ldquo;only we don&rsquo;t want
you to sacrifice too much.&rdquo; And that was the signal
for a second close formation of happy people about
Aunt Katherine&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sacrifice! Why, all I want in the world is my
family. Don&rsquo;t talk about sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was much later that Aunt Katherine began
wondering about dinner. What had become of it?
Nick and Katherine had utterly forgotten that one
does usually dine sometime before bedtime. They
laughed at the suddenness of their return to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring the bell, Kate, and see if the servants are
dead or asleep,&rdquo; Miss Frazier said.</p>
<p>But at that instant Effie appeared in the door.
She had heard Miss Frazier&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Julia put
dinner off an hour,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s served
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;now,&rdquo; however, was almost lost in Katherine&rsquo;s
sudden pounce upon the servant and her
hearty handshake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;Julia often takes a good deal upon herself,&rdquo;
Miss Frazier observed, as linked with Katherine she
led their little procession toward the dining-room.</p>
<p>And their first view of the table justified Aunt
Katherine in this criticism of Julia. The polished
surface of the cherished antique was hidden under an
enormous damask cloth. But worse than that, the
jade dish with its exquisite floating blossoms had
given way to a huge, and to Miss Frazier&rsquo;s mind
hideous, cut-glass punch-bowl full of roses, dozens
and dozens of roses, pink, red, and yellow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they have made it into a festival,&rdquo; Katherine
cried, surveying the effect. &ldquo;Smell those roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See them, rather,&rdquo; Miss Frazier responded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the servants. They must have known you
both were here; and yes, there are two extra places
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Julia, the lamb!&rdquo; Katherine declared.
&ldquo;Bless her dear heart. I saw her looking from the
kitchen window as we ran in. I&rsquo;d go and kiss her
this second, but she wouldn&rsquo;t approve of that until
after dinner. Julia&rsquo;s a lion for etiquette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be so considerate as not to begin spoiling
the servants, Katherine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Nick and Kate and Elsie looked at Aunt Katherine,
surprised. But Katherine simply answered lightly,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s they who spoil me.&rdquo; She accepted the tone
of her aunt&rsquo;s command without dismay. She knew
that the apparent sharpness had been only Aunt
Katherine&rsquo;s old habit of criticism reasserting itself
toward a beloved niece, who to her mind could never
possibly be anything but the child she had &ldquo;brought
up.&rdquo; Katherine had begun to understand her aunt
to-night for the first time, to see her in the &ldquo;other
light&rdquo; that the King of the Fairies knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better excuse yourself to wash your hands
and remove that odd-looking rain-soaked tam,&rdquo;
Aunt Katherine picked on her again, the minute they
were seated. &ldquo;Use my bathroom, it&rsquo;s the nearest.
And hurry right back, or this surprisingly sumptuous-looking
soup that Julia has provided will get cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine, obediently leaving the room, looked
rather like a humble child, but Nick&rsquo;s eyes, as he
stood, followed as though hers might have been the
departure of an empress.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Late that night the doors between the girls&rsquo; rooms
blew shut in the wind that was clearing the air of
storm and rain. Never mind about the doors,
though; the spirit of Miss Frazier&rsquo;s rule rather than
the letter was being kept to-night. For Kate and
Elsie were curled up within whispering distance of
each other on Kate&rsquo;s bed. Both were in dressing
gowns; they were supposed to have been asleep for
an hour past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been abroad, or even anywhere out of
New England,&rdquo; Kate was whispering. &ldquo;You went
with Aunt Katherine last summer. Will it be so
wonderful as I expect?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were only in England. And it will be a
million times more wonderful than then, for we shall
be together. Why, two weeks from now, sooner, we
ought to be in Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two weeks ago we had never heard of each
other,&rdquo; Kate added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one day ago,&rdquo; Elsie took it up, &ldquo;if you had
told me that I would spend the rest of the summer
away from my father, travelling in Europe with you
and Aunt Katherine, I would have said you were
crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Elsie,&rdquo; Kate asked quickly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said
anything, but is that awfully hard for you, leaving
them in Ashland, while we go so far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more awful for me to leave my father
than for you to leave your mother, I guess. Anyway,
when <i>they</i> like the plan so much, we&rsquo;d be funny
daughters not to be pleased, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say &lsquo;My father, your mother&rsquo;&mdash;Oh, Elsie,
do you realize in just a day or two it will be &lsquo;our
father and our mother&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Kate,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
have given me a mother and I have given you a
father, and now we are a family. I feel, do you
know, as though my heart might burst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it,&rdquo; Kate warned quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
need it strong for climbing the Alps! Imagine! Oh,
how glorious it all is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we come home again and live in that
funny little barn-house of yours&mdash;I am thinking of
that,&rdquo; Elsie whispered. &ldquo;That will be better than
travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Hart boys are going to be simply flabbergasted,&rdquo;
Kate said, remembering them. &ldquo;They
kept telling me to bring you home with me, but they
never guessed you&rsquo;d be my sister when you did
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think they will want to have anything
to do with me?&rdquo; Elsie asked, diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, that letter they wrote&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s face reddened. &ldquo;What a creature I was!
Of course, they will forget all about that now. Even
if you weren&rsquo;t my sister and Mother&rsquo;s daughter,
they&rsquo;d like you awfully just the first second they saw
you. They couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before going to bed, finally, the girls put out the
lights and went out on to Kate&rsquo;s flowery balcony to
look at the clearing night. They stood close together,
their arms about each other&rsquo;s shoulders,
their dressing gowns billowing in the fresh wind.
Elsie lifted her face up toward the sky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going
to be a fair day to-morrow,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;See
the stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s face was lifted, too. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you remember what the King of the Fairies told
Hazel and her lover about the magic they had made
their very own, how it&rsquo;s safer than the stars from
troubling? Well, do you know, <i>as a family</i>, I think
we are going to have a lot of that magic.&rdquo;</p>
